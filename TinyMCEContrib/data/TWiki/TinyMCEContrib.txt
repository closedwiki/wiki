<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/tinymce.gif" alt="tinymce.gif" style="float:right" />
This is an integration of the !TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor. As well as being fast, the editor has one very attractive feature - search and replace.

The integration uses the TWiki:Plugins.WysiwygPlugin to translate text to and from a format that !TinyMCE can edit.

At this point the skin for the editor is *very* simple, and the editor is show with default buttons that probably don't work. %RED% It needs someone with knowledge of HTML and CSS to sit down and polish the integration. %ENDCOLOR%

*Caveat*: %TOPIC% is designed for editing TWiki topics, not as a general purpose HTML editor. It will work fine on topics that contain text, TML formatting, and most HTML. However, because of the complexity of transforming TML into HTML and back, complex TML, and mixing HTML and TML may not give the results you expect. You are recommended to use the standard browser textarea editor for editing existing topics that contain mixed HTML and TML, or complex %<nop>TML%-type variables.

---++ Installation Instructions

First follow the installation instructions to install the Contrib:

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

*Do not forget to enable the WysiwygPlugin in =configure= or it won't work*.

	* To enable the editor in one of your skins, add the following link to the skin alongside or in place of the existing 'edit' link:<br /><code>&lt;a href="%<nop>SCRIPTURLPATH%/edit%<nop>SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%<nop>WEB%/%<nop>TOPIC%?skin=tinymce"&gt;tinymce&lt;/a&gt;</code><br />As you can see this is just a standard edit link with the 'tinymce' skin in place of the usual edit skin. Here it is for this topic: <a href="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/edit%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?skin=tinymce">TinyMCE</a>. Try clicking on it, but _do not save_!

If you are using TWiki-4.0.0 or later with =pattern= skin, the =%<nop>COMPOSER%= global TWiki variable is used to control the skin used for the WYSIWYG editor link. You can define this variable to the empty string to disable WYSIWYG editing on a site, per-web, per-user or per-topic basis. Set =COMPOSER= to =tinymce= to enable this module.
