# Example httpd.conf file for TWiki.
#
# You are recommended to take a copy of this file and edit
# the paths to match your installation. Then add:
# include "/home/httpd/twiki/twiki_httpd.conf"
# to the end of your main httpd.conf file.
#

# The first parameter will be part of the URL to your installation e.g.
# http://my.co.uk/twiki/bin/view/...
# The second parameter must point to the physical path on your disc. Be
# careful not to lose any trailing /'s.

#### Change the _second_ path to match your local installation
ScriptAlias /twiki/bin/ "/home/httpd/twiki/bin/"

# This defines a url that points to the root of the twiki installation. It is
# used to access files in the pub directory (attachments etc)
# It must come _after_ the ScriptAlias.

#### Change the path to match your local installation
Alias /twiki/ "/home/httpd/twiki/"

# This specifies the options on the TWiki scripts directory. The ExecCGI
# and SetHandler tell apache that it contains scripts. "Allow from all"
# lets any IP address access this URL.

#### Change the path to match your local installation
<Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/bin">
	 Options +ExecCGI
	 SetHandler cgi-script
	 Allow from all
</Directory>

# This sets the options on the pub directory, which contains attachments and
# other files like CSS stylesheets and icons. AllowOverride None stops a
# user installing a .htaccess file that overrides these options.

# Note that files in pub are *not* protected by TWiki Access Controls,
# so if you want to control access to files attached to topics, you may
# need to add your own .htaccess files to subdirectories of pub. See the
# Apache documentation on .htaccess for more info.

#### Change the path to match your local installation
<Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/pub">
	 Options FollowSymLinks +Includes
	 AllowOverride None
	 Allow from all
</Directory>

# Security note: All other directories should be set so
# that they are *not* visible as URLs, so we set them as =deny from all=.

#### Change the paths to match your local installation
<Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/data">
	 deny from all
</Directory>

<Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/templates">
	 deny from all
</Directory>

<Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/lib">
	 deny from all
</Directory>
