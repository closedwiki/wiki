---+!! <nop>%TOPIC%

This plugin is inspired by the <nop>WordPress <nop>TimeSince plugin.
It which can be used to display a time difference in a human readable way, for instance to tell you that a topic has been published "2 days, 3 hours ago".

There are some problems with the original [[http://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/time-since][TimeSince plugin for WordPress]]. For example, it was only able to display a time diff with at most two expressions: "1day, 2hours ago" or "1 week ago" but not "1 day, 2 hours and 3 minutes".
It even displays only one time expression if the difference does not occure in two adjacent time units (time units are year, month, week, day, hour, minute). 
If a time interval differs in week and hour the <nop>TimeSince WP plugin will only display the week difference and not the hours as week and hour are not adjacent. This is fixed in the TimeSincePlugin for TWiki. Several other parameters have been added
to give a finer control of the format and the information displayed.
