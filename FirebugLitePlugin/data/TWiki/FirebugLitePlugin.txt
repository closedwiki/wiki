Firebug is an extension for Firefox, but what happens when you need to test your pages in Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari?

The solution is Firebug Lite, a JavaScript file you can insert into your pages to simulate some Firebug features in browsers that are not named "Firefox".

Firebug Lite creates the variables "firebug" and "pi" and doesn't affect or interfere with HTML elements that aren't created by itself

---++ Usage
   1 install and enable %TOPIC%
   2 hit F12 - this should bring up the firebuglite console.
   
---++ TODO
   1 change the path to the =firebug-lite.css= file to a local TWiki path
   2 add a setting to add =debug="true"= to the html tag, to always bring up the console.
