---+!! PublishContrib

_Previously known as !GenHTMLAddOn, and then !PublishAddOn_.

%TOC%

---++ Summary

Generates a ZIP file containing a static view of a web.

When TWiki generates a view, it does so dynamically i.e. there's a CGI script that runs, processes some files, and generates HTML that is displayed by the browser. There are circumstances in which this may not be desirable or even possible. For example:
	1 TWiki is used to create documentation which has to be bundled into a product release,
	1 Published versions of TWiki pages must be read-only,
	1 The TWiki server is inaccessible to the audience (e.g. on the other side of a corporate firewall).

PublishContrib provides support for the generation of stand-alone HTML from a TWiki web. It will generate a zip file containing rendered versions of a set of TWiki pages together with any attached files.

*WARNING* The zip files can get pretty big, and the process itself puts a heavy load on the server for large webs.

---++ Features

	* All standard TWiki tags are interpreted
	* Plugins are called
	* UnresolvedLinks to non-existant topics are silently ignored
	* Topic links internal to the web are translated to relative links
	* External links (outside this web) are left untouched
	* Any links to the 'pub' areas of topics in the web are automatically resolved and the referenced files copied into the 'images' subdirectory.
	* Powerful support for choosing what content gets published

---++ Usage

The easiest way to publish a web is from this topic, by filling in the following form.

The ZIP file is generated in a directory designated during installation. The progress messages printed during documentation generation tell you where this is.

Ypu can also create a permanent topic in a web to help with the publishing process. See [[#PublishTopic][below]].

<form method="POST" name="rename" action="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/publish%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%">
<table>
<tr>
  <td valign="top"> Web to publish </td>
  <td> <input type="text" name="web" value="%URLPARAM{"web" default="%WEB%"}%"></input></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign="top"> Comma-separated list of [[#WildcardPattern][wildcard patterns]] that match the names of topics to *include* </td>
  <td> <input type="text" name="inclusions" value="%URLPARAM{"inclusions" default="*"}%" size="50"/></td>

  <td valign="top"> Comma-separated list of [[#WildcardPattern][wildcard patterns]] that match the names of topics to *exclude* </td>

  <td>
   <input type="text" name="publishskin" size="20" value="%PUBLISHSKIN%" /><br />
   You are recommended to pick =print.pattern= or =plain= or =print= skin. Your installation may also offer a special =export= skin.

#WildcardPattern
---+++ Wildcard Patterns
Wildcard patterns are well known to people who are used to command lines on computers, but may be unfamiliar to the Windows generation. A wildcard is a special string that you can put into a filename so that it matches a whole range of files:
| *String* | *What  it does* | *Example* | *What the example matches* |
| * | Matches any string, including an empty string. | =*Cheese*= | Every topic with "Cheese" somewhere in the name (but _not_ "cheese") |
| ? | Matches any single character. | Example1? | Example10 and Example 1X but _not_ example1 |
| [...] | Matches any one of the enclosed characters.  A pair of characters separated by a hyphen denotes a range  expression; any  character that sorts between those two characters, inclusive, using the current locale's collating sequence and character set, is matched.  If the first character following the [ is a ^ then any character not enclosed is matched. A - may be matched by including it as the first or  last  character  in  the set.  A ] may be matched by including it as the first character in the set.<br /> Within  [  and ], character classes can be specified using the syntax [:class:], where class is one of the following classes defined in the POSIX.2 standard: =alnum=, =alpha=, =ascii=, =blank=, =cntrl=, =digit=, =graph=, =lower=, =print=, =punct=, =space=, =upper=, =word=, =xdigit=. A character class matches any character belonging to that class.  The =word= character class matches letters, digits, and the character _. | B[aeiou]g | Bag, Bog, Big, Beg, Bug |

#RegularExpression
---+++ Regular Expressions
A perl regular expression. You can use a simple string here, which will be matched exactly, or you can read up on perl regular expressions on the web. 

---+++ Using a Publish Topic
You can create a publish topic in a web that contains all the details needed to publish that web. This is just a topic with a series of standard TWiki variable settings in it. You can use the PublishWeb topic in this web as a template for your own topics.

---+++ Controlling what gets published
You can control what gets published from a topic using the &lt;nopublish&gt; .. &lt;/nopublish&gt; tags (anything between the tags will not be published).

---+ Settings
   * Name of the perl package
      * Set STUB = %$STUB%
   * Short description
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Generate static HTML for a TWiki Web

---++++ Known problems
	* Doesn't handle revision info tags in templates
	* Plugin tags that create complex HTML (sug as TWikiDraw DRAWING tags) are not handled correctly.
	* Links to excluded topics get generated as links

---+++ Installation Instructions
   * Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below). Contents:
   | *File:* | *Description:* |
%$MANIFEST%
   * Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory.
   * =perl= ==%TOPIC%_installer.pl== =install= to automatically check and install other TWiki modules that this module depends on, and configure the plugin. This script also includes an =uninstall= option should you ever wish to remove the plugin from your installation, and an =upgrade= option that will automatically download and install the latest version of the add-on.
   * If the install script fails for any reason, you may need to define the configuration yourself. Create a file called =LocalSite.cfg= in the same directory as your =TWiki.cfg= and add the following lines:
<blockquote>
<verbatim>
$TWiki::cfg{PublishContrib}{Dir} = "dir_path";
$TWiki::cfg{PublishContrib}{URL} = "url_path";
</verbatim>
Where =dir_path= is the file system path to your publish directory on the server, and =url_path= is the URL of the same directory.

Then edit =TWiki.cfg= and add the following line to the end:
<verbatim>
do 'LocalSite.cfg';
</verbatim>
</blockquote>
