The example above was generated by the content of the topic FlowchartPluginExample

The items of the flowchart are defined in the following way:

<verbatim>
---++ Item of the Flowchart
   * Id: unique_name
   * Type: Question
   * Yes: item_A
   * No: item_B
</verbatim>

A more complete example is available at [[FlowchartPlugin Example]], once the plugin is installed.

---++ Syntax Rules

To create and display the flowchart, use the variable =%<nop>FLOWCHART%= or =%<nop>FLOWCHART{...}%=.

This plugin uses the content of the topic and considers that each level two heading (=---++=) indicate the beginning of the definition of a new item of the flowchart.

To specify the item and the derived action is expected a list of the type  =* Attribute: Value=

|  *Attribute*  |  *Description*  |
| =Type= | Type of the flowchart's item. Default: =Action=. See the valid types in the table below |
| =Id= | Identification for the =Goto=. It needs to validate with =/[_a-zA-Z0-9]*/= |
| =Color= | Color differentiated for the item |
| =Goto= | Indicates so that item it must follow. Default: =Next= |
| =Yes= | The same as =Goto=, but is required for =Type: Question= |
| =No= | The same as =Goto=, but is required for =Type: Question= |

The valid types are:

|  *Type*  |  *Description*  |
| =Start= | Indicates the beginning of a flowchart. This must be the first item |
| =Action= | The standard type. It indicates an action |
| =Question= | Opens a fork in the flow. It requires the definition of attributes =Yes= and =No= |
| =End= | Indicates the end of the flowchart (or part of it) |
| =End-Error= | End for the error case |

To control the beginning and end of of valid headings for the construction of the Flowchart use =%<nop>FLOWCHART_START%= and =%<nop>FLOWCHART_STOP%=.

If a name is excessively big for the space of the item a line break can be made with =%<nop>FLOWCHART_BR%=. This will not intervene with the text of the page, only in the flowchart.

You can changes the appearance of the flowchart by adding the following parameters to the variable:

|  *Parameter*  |  *Description*  |
| =item-w= | Width for the flowchart's itens area |
| =item-h= | Height for the flowchart's itens |
| =area-w= | Width of the area of the flowchart's itens |
| =area-h= | Height of the area of the flowchart's itens |
| =percent= | Percentage of the PNG size presented in relation to the standard of the generated SVG |
| =text-size= | Size in pixels of the font text |
| =tag-style= | Style for the =img= tag |

---+++ Tips

%I% Web bowsers normally make a cache of the web page and images. It is possible that after a change to the flowchart you do not see the image update. If this happens click "Reload" in your web browser to clear the cache.

%I% Some flowcharts can become so complex and will be difficult to follow its lines. In this case, increase the area of items, giving a bigger space between them. _eg:_ =%<nop>FLOWCHART{ area-w="220" area-h="100" }%=

---++ Construction of the Flowchart

   1 The blocks initialized by a heading level two =---++= are read as definition of item of the Flowchart (in the same way as the TWiki:Plugins.SlideShowPlugin).
   1 An SVG is created with this information and is attached to the topic. This SVG file can be accessed by =%<nop>ATTACHURL%/flowchart_%<nop>TOPIC%.svg=.
   1 A PNG is generated by [[http://www.imagemagick.org][ImageMagick]] and reduced, so that the image has a good anti-aliasing, that it is not obtained in the direct conversion. The PNG is attached to the topic and can be accessed by =%<nop>ATTACHURL%/flowchart_%<nop>TOPIC%.png= (use this to separate the flowchart's image of the definition topic when it is rendered).
   1 A map for the image is created linking the items of the flowchart with the origin of its information, which can contain more information for the implementation. =%<nop>ATTACHURL%/flowchartMapImg_%<nop>TOPIC%.txt= (use to map the image out of the topic where the flowchart was generated)
     %BR% =%<nop>INCLUDE{"%<nop>PUBURL%/Web/FlowchartTopic/flowchartMapImg_FlowchartTopic.txt"}%=
     %BR% =&lt;img src="%<nop>PUBURL%/Web/FlowchartTopic/flowchart_<nop>FlowchartTopic.png" usemap="flowchart_<nop>FlowchartTopic" alt="Flowchart" border="0" />=
   1 The content of the map file and one image tag presenting the PNG are placed in the place of variable =%<nop>FLOWCHART%=.

The files (SVG, PNG and Map) are generated when the topic contend =%<nop>FLOWCHART%= is saved.

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>FLOWCHARTPLUGIN_ITEM_WIDTH%==

To override the default settings, add them to [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]].

   * Default width for the flowchart's itens
      * Set ITEM_WIDTH = 140
   * Default height for the flowchart's itens
      * Set ITEM_HEIGHT = 40
   * Default width for the area of the flowchart's itens
      * Set ITEM_AREA_W = 180
   * Default height of the area of the flowchart's itens
      * Set ITEM_AREA_H = 70
   * Default size in pixels of the font text
      * Set TEXT_SIZE = 17
   * Default percentage of the PNG size presented in relation to the standard of the generated SVG
      * Set PERCENT_IMG = 70
   * Default style for the =img= tag
      * Set TAG_STYLE = border:1px dotted #505050;

   * One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Create a flowchart from topic text
