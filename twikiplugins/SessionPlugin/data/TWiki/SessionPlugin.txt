This Plugin allows session information to be retained whilst a browser is running.  It does this by storing a small session cookie in the browser.  This contains an identification string that TWiki users to extract session information on the server.



Notes:

	* The cookie is not persistant

	* The session information is stored in files under =data/.sessions/=

	* Old session files should be deleted by a cron job
