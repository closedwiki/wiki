%TOC%

A clone of !EditTablePlugin that supports editing a single row in a table
at a time, in-place in the table.
Multiple tables in a topic are supported, but only one table at a time
can be open for editing.

Works like the !EditTablePlugin (it uses exactly the same =%EDITTABLE= tags) and
you can use it to edit the entire table. The main purpose, though, is to support
editing one row at a time. Closed rows are shown with
an edit %ICON{edittopic}% button.

So why should you use this plugin instead of the !EditTablePlugin?
   1 You don't see all the edit controls unless you can change the topic. This means that people
     without write access aren't bothered by lots of pointless controls everywhere.
   1 You can edit one row at a time, instead of having to edit the entire
     table. This solves the problem with the long page rendering times
     required to show all the HTML for a full table edit on big tables.
   1 Supports moving rows around in the table, deleting and adding rows.
   1 The plugin doesn't use !JavaScript (except for the calendar) and
     doesn't do anything clever with CSS, so it should work with all browsers.
   1 The plugin is coded using a clean object-oriented architecture, which
     means it is easily extensible.

At this time most features of !EditTablePlugin are supported. Known exceptions
are:
   * the =helptopic= and =editbutton= switches, which are ignored,
   * the =EDITCELL= feature, which is not supported,
   * The "Initial values" feature, which is incompatible with the way this plugin adds new rows.

---++ Usage

Add =%<nop>EDITTABLE{...}%= on the line before the first row of an existing table to make it editable. Parameters:

   * =format= - The format of the cells in a row of the table. The format is defined like a table row, where the cell data specify the type for each cell. For example, =format="| text,16 | label |"=. Cells can be any of the following types:
      * =text, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;initial value&gt;=. Simple text field
      * =textarea, &lt;rows&gt;x&lt;columns&gt;, &lt;initial value&gt;=. Multirow text box
      * =select, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;option 1&gt;, &lt;option 2&gt;, etc*<nop>=
        Select one from a list of choices.
      * =radio, &lt;size*&gt;, &lt;option 1&gt;, &lt;option 2&gt;,= etc. size
        indicates the number of buttons per line in edit mode | | =%VBAR% 
      * =checkbox, &lt;size*&gt;, &lt;option 1&gt;, &lt;option 2&gt;, etc= - as radio
      * label, 0, &lt;label text&gt; - fixed label
      * =row= - the row number, automatically worked out
      * =date, &lt;size&gt;, &lt;initial value&gt;, &lt;DHTML date format&gt;
   * =changerows= - Rows can be added and removed if ="on"=. Rows can be added but
     not removed if ="add"=
   * =quietsave= - Quiet Save button is shown if ="on"=
   * =include= - Name of another topic defining the EDITTABLE parameters. The first
     %<nop>EDITTABLE% in the topic is used. This is useful if you have many topics
     with the same table format and you want to update the format in one place.
   * =headerislabel= - The first row of the table is treated as a label row if ="on"=

Table rows are shown with a row edit button %ICON{edittopic}% in the first column,
and a table edit button <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/edittable.gif" /> after the
table. When the table is
edited, then a number of buttons may be shown depending on the
settings of =changerows= and =quietsave=.
   * %ICON{save}% saves the changes
   * <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/quiet.gif" /> saves without notification
   * %ICON{plus}% adds a new row after the current row, taking for its contents whatever you entered into the current row
   * %ICON{minus}% deletes the row
   * $ICON{arrowup}% Move this row up one row in the table
   * $ICON{arrowdown}% Move this row down one row in the table
   * %ICON{stop}% cancels the open edit

If the plugin is installed and working *and you can modify this topic* then
the following examples will be editable.
