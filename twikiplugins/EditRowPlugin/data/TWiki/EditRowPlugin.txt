Supports editing a single row in a table at a time, in-place in the table.
Multiple tables in a topic are supported, but only once table at a time
can be edited.

Works like the !EditTablePlugin (it uses exactly the same =%EDITTABLE= tags)
except that it only opens one row at a time. Closed rows are shown with
an edit button.

This solves the problem with the long page rendering times required to show all
the HTML for a full table edit. At this time most, but possibly not all,
features of !EditTablePlugin are supported; it's hard to tell exactly,
because there are no tests for EditTablePlugin, the documentation is
incomplete and the code is rather hard to read.

The plugin doesn't use !JavaScript (except for the
calendar) so it should work with all browsers.

See also: !EditTablePlugin, !EditTableRowPlugin.

---++ Usage

See EditTablePlugin for information on the =%EDITTABLE= tag and its parameters.

The plugin needs to be put on the INSTALLEDPLUGINS list before
!EditTablePlugin if both are required. It is enabled by setting
   * <nop>Set ENABLE_TABLE_ROW_EDIT = on
in a topic or !WebPreferences. Where this variable is set, then row editing
will be used instead of table editing.
