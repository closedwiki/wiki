Instead of popping up a login box to find out which user is editing a page, I wrote an adding that sends a cookie to the user's web browser when they register. from then on the user can be identified using the cookie that they send back.

---++ WARNING:
 
This plugin uses a modified Plugins.pm & TWiki.pm & register
	* generalised the method that the SessionPlugin uses
	* added another Plugin method to send the cookie out.
	* register calls the new plugin method
	* if the user topic exists, the register script does not overwrite the existing page
		* this is so the user can get the cookie from multiple computers.

*I don't know how the UserCookiePlugin and the SessionPlugin co-exist.*
	* I suspect that the SessionPlugin would stop the registration cookie being sent

---++ Syntax Rules

	There is no special syntax. you may need to change the cookie expireation date to use the format that your WebServer requires (I found that IIS's date format changed depending on the version and localization setting.)

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Settings

There are no setting currently
