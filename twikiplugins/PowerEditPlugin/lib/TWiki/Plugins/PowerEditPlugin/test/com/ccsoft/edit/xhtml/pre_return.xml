<h4>PRE element using hard returns for linefeed</h4>



<pre>



Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.



Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.



All the King's horses and all the King's men,



Couldn't put Humpty together again.







They called a doctor from the town.



To come and fix poor Humpty's crown.



He put a stitch in Humpty's leg.



And bandaged up poor Humpty's egg.







He used some tape and then some glue,



And Humpty's now as good as new.



</pre>
