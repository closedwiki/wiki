<pre width="30">

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the King's horses and all the King's men, Couldn't put Humpty together again.<br />

<br />

They called a doctor from the town. To come and fix poor Humpty's crown. He put a stitch in Humpty's leg. And bandaged up poor Humpty's egg.<br />

<br />

He used some tape and then some glue, And Humpty's now as good as new.
