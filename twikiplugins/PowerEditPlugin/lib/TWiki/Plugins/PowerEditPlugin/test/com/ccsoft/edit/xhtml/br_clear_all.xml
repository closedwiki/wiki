<!-- To check the BR tag. If the normal BR tag is used, text will keep filling in next to a displayed image.  In order to stop filling in next to the image you must issue an expanded BR tag.  Such as BR CLEAR=ALL.-->

<title>XHTML Functional -- BR - CLEAR=all</title>

</head>

<body>

The expanded BR tag will drop the text to the base of the image and

begin rendering. 

<!-- Expected result:The first pargraph of text should be aligned between the images. The second paragraph of text should render below the both images.-->

    <img src="../images/image.gif" align="left" alt="image"/> <img

src="images/image.gif" align="right" alt="image"/> With floating images (refer

to image alignment) the (break) BR tag has to be expanded. If you

wish to stop filling the space next to an aligned image and start

on the next line underneath the image, then a normal line break

will not work - it will just break the line to the current margin

alongside the image. A new paragraph will also continue wrapping

the text alongside the image. <br clear="all" />

 However, this sentence should be rendered below the both images

since it follows a BR tag that has CLEAR=ALL assigned.
