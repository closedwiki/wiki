<!-- Purpose: To test the DEL element and the datetime attribute. The DEL element allows a author to mark up up sections of a document by deleting block-level or inline elements. The datetime element documents the date and time when the deletion was made.-->

<!-- Expected result:  The phrase ", which I am now selling for only 40 dollars," is contained in the DEL element. This text should be shown as strikethrough text. -->
