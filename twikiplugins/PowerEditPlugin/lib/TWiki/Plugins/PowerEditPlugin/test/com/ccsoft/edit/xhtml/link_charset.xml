<!-- Purpose: To test the CHARSET attribute of the LINK element -->

<!-- Expected result: The 'charset' attribute specifies to the browser that the character encoding of the referenced document is 'ISO 8859-1' -->

<title>XHTML Functional -- LINK - CHARSET=ISO 8859-1</title>

<link charset="ISO 8859-1" href="http://home.netscape.com" />

</head>

<body>

<p>In the &lt;HEAD&gt; element, the LINK element is assigned a

charset value of 'ISO 8859-1'. The 'charset' attribute specifies to

the browser the character encoding of the referenced document. The

referenced document in this case is Netscape's home page.</p>
