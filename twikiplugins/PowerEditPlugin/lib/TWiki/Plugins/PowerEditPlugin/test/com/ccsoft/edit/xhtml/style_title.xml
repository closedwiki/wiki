<!-- Purpose: To test the STYLE element with the TYPE attribute. The TITLE attribute gives a title to the style sheet. With a TITLE attribute, the style sheet is automatically applied, but the user may choose to disable the style sheet while keeping or enabling other style sheets. Style sheets with the same title are considered to be the same style sheet -->

<!-- Expected result: There are no actual results since disabling a style sheet is not a feature of the HTML Transitional DTD. However, the user should see a paragraph bordered in red. -->

<title>HTML Functional -- STYLE - TYPE</title>

<style type="text/css" title="sheet_1">

 .one { border: solid red }

</style>

</head>

<body>

<p class="one">This paragraph should be bordered in red. View

source and verify that the STYLE element has a 'title' attribute

and that the 'title' attribute has a value of "sheet_1"</p>

</body>
