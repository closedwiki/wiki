<!-- Purpose: To test the option element with the disabled attribute -->

<!-- Expected result: Should create two text input fields; the second one should not do anything, receive focus, be tabbed into, etc. -->

<title>XHTML Functional -- INPUT - DISABLED</title>

</head>

<body>

<p>This test case uses two text input fields. The first field can

be edited, the second field uses the DISABLED attribute. The

DISABLED prevents the field from be edited or getting focus.</p>
