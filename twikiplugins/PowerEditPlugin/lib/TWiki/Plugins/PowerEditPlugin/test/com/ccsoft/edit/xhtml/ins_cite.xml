<!-- Purpose: To test the INS Element. The INS element allows a author to markup up sections of a document by inserting block-level or inline elements. The CITE element is to point to another HTML file which contains comments on the reason for the insertion.-->

<!-- Expected result:  The phrase ", when using the Photo Cartridge," is contained in the INS Element. This text should be shown as underlined text. -->
