Provides support for a new type, =date=, in form fields. When a form field is set to this type it will no longer be editable by normal means, but only through a date selection popup.

*WARNING: TWiki-4 only. If you want to use this plugin with an earlier version of TWiki, please see [[http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/%TOPIC%?rev=1.5][here]]*

---+ Usage

In a form definition, enter =date= where you would normally put =text= . For example:
<verbatim>
| Birthday | date | 0 | 1 April 2004 | A date |
</verbatim>
This will display an *uneditable* text field and a date selection icon that can be clicked to use the Mishoo Javascript calendar widget to insert a date. The =size= field is ignored.

If you want to use Javascript to create other data types in form fields, you can use this plugin as a model of how to do it.

---+ Settings
	* Description:
	* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Adds a =date= type to forms
	* #Set DATEFORMAT = %d %b %Y 
      * Format changed to make it sortable in TWiki tables. To get the old Format like "3 April 2005" set DATEFORMAT to '%e %B %Y'
See JSCalendarContrib for additional settings.
