---+ Immediate Notify Plugin

This is a plugin that allows users to register to be immediately notified when topics or webs are modified.

---++ Syntax Rules

Once the plugin is installed, users can register for notification in the Web<nop>ImmediateNotify topics by including their username as an entry in a list.  In order to recieve notifications, they must also configure their desired notification method.  Since SMTP and Jabber are currently the only available methods, this consists of:
	* Adding a line ="		* Set IMMEDIATENOTIFYMETHOD = Jabber"= (or "SMTP", respectively) to their topic.
	* Adding a line ="Jabber: jabber_user@jabber_server.org"= to their topic for notification per Jabber (no configuration is needed for SMTP).

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Global Settings

	* One line description, shown in the %TWIKIWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Allows immediate notification of topic changes.

	* Notification method configuration:
		* Set METHODS = 
	* Jabber method configuration:
		* Set JABBER_USERNAME = 
		* Set JABBER_PASSWORD = 
		* Set JABBER_SERVER = 

	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0
