Table of contents and cross-reference management

This plugin adds powerful support for generation and maintenance of tables of contents and cross-references within a TWiki web. Originally developed for use by Motorola documentation teams using the Dec2000 release, it has been packaged as a plugin and updated for the Sep 2001 release.

---+++ Syntax Rules

Adds a number of new tags:
	* %<nop>SECTIONn% - inserts an anchored section header
	* %<nop>CONTENTS% - generates a table of contents for a topic or an entire web, with full expansion depth control
	* %<nop>REF% - inserts a symbolically named cross-reference URL
	* %<nop>ANCHOR% - inserts a symbolically named jump target

The Plugins.<nop>TocPluginHelp topic in the installation contains complete help information.

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Settings

	* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Sophisticated table of contents generation
	* Set DEBUG = 0
