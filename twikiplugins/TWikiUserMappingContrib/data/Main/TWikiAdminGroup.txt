      * Set GROUP =

__%X% NOTE:__ You can login as the built-in Admin user using the password set in configure.
   * Unless your TWiki is configured to use !TemplateLogin, you first need to be logged in as a normal registered user
   * Authenticate as the internal TWiki administrator using the [[%SCRIPTURL{login}%?sudo=sudo][internal admin login]] (use the username already suggested and the password set in configure).
   * Once you are a member of the !TWikiAdminGroup you automatically get admin privileges when you do a normal login.

__%X% NOTE:__ If you lock yourself out of <nop>TWikiAdminGroup during setup activities and have forgotten the configure password, you can edit this group topic at file system level using any text file editor (as a last resort.)
