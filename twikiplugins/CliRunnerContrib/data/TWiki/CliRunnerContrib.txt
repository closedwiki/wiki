---+!! CliRunnerContrib Contrib Package

This is a Contrib targeted at TWiki developers.  It allows to run
independent TWiki scripts from your TWiki code (mostly unit tests).

Note that the detailed documentation has been generated automatically
by the TWiki:Plugins.BuildContrib, and would need care to be
comprehensible.  For use cases and examples, see the SVN file
=test/unit/WebTestCasesAutoTests.pm= (a unit test running tests from
SVN's !TestCases web) and the test cases file provided with this
plugin, also only in SVN.

---++ Summary of Contents

This contrib describes a =$runner= object which allows to run TWiki
scripts from your TWiki code in an independent process.  The object
methods allow to change the options, configuration, and module
environment for the single request performed by the independent
process.  All other simultaneous TWiki operations remain unaffected.
