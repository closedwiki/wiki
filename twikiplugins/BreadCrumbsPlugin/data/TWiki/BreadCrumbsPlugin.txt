---++ Description
This plugin has the sole purpose to help you in locating where you are and how
you can escape from there using breadcrumbs navigation. 

For now this plugin generates so called "location" breadcrumbs. Compare this to
"path" breadcrumbs indicating the path a user has taken to arrive at a page which
is a kind of page history without navigation circles.
But this is not yet supported by the <nop>BreadCrumbsPlugin. 

In a way location breadcrumbs have always been supported by TWiki using the
=META{"parent"}= variable to display the list of partent topics. Since version
4.x  TWiki also supports hierarchical subwebs but the breadcrumbs support of
TWiki does not allow to display the parent webs as part of of the location
breadcrumbs.  Besides that this plugin adds more flexibility in deciding which
parts of the breadcrumbs path should be rendered and how each
individual breadcrumb is displayed


---++ Syntax
=%<nop>BREADCRUMBS%, %<nop>BREADCRUMBS{"&lt;web>.&lt;topic>" ...}%=

*Parameters*:
	* =&lt;web>.&lt;topic>=: the location to which breadcrumbs should be generated;
	  defaults to the current topic
	* =header=: format string prepended to the output result
	* =format=: format string to render one item on the breadcrumbs path
	  (defaults to '[<nop>[$target][$name]]')
	* =footer=: format string appended to the output result
	* =separator=: format string to be put between items
	  (defaults to one space char)
	* =include=: regular expression items must match to be part of the path
	* =exclude=: regular expression items must _not_ match to be part of the path
	* =recurse=: can be one or more of the following values (comma separated) to
	  deside which parts of the breadcrumbs path should be included (defaults to 'on'):
		* =on=: include all parent webs and all parent topics
		* =off=: include only the current web and the current topic
		* =weboff=: don't recurse on webs, include only the current web
		* =topicoff=: don't recurse on topics, include only the current topic
		* =webonce=: include the next parent web but not the parent web's parent web
		* =topiconce=: include the next parent topic but not the parent topic's parent topic
		* =once=: short formf of =webonce, topiconce=
		
*Pseudo-variables*: %BR%
Each of the above format strings (format, header, footer,
separator) may contain special variables:
   * =$name=: the name of the breadcrumb, this is the topic name or the web name having its
     parent web part being stripped off (that is =Bar= instead of =Sandbox/Foo/Bar=)
   * =$target=: the full =web.topic= of the breadcrumb 
   * =$n=: replaced with a newline char (\n)
   * =$percnt=: replaced with a percent char (%)
   * =$dollar=: replaced with a dollar char ($)
   * =$nop=: removed from the format string before expanding common TWiki variables
