---+ <nop>WebDAV for TWiki

<nop>WebDAV stands for "Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning". It is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allows users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers.

TWiki integration with <nop>WebDAV means that users can edit attachments on topics by dragging and dropping the attachment from the TWiki topic into an appropriate <nop>WebDAV enabled client program, such as Microsoft&trade; Word&trade; or KWrite. Given the URL of the attachment, they can also be opened directly from applications i.e. the integration publishes TWiki attachment files in a web folder. Saving back the attachment automatically creates a new version. By opening a Web Folder on the attachment directory, users can drag and drop attachments into the topic, and they will automatically be versioned and added to the topic attachment table.

TWiki protections on topics are honoured through use of a Plugin that caches protections in a database, allowing Apache to rapidly test them when a file in a TWiki folder is being accessed.

The TWiki DAV integration consists of a [[http://webdav.org/mod_dav/][mod_dav]] based Apache module, a bin script used for checking in, and the plugin used to extract protections. The Apache module is based on mod_dav version 1.0.3 and includes all of the functionality of that module, so should be a drop-in replacement on Apache 1.3 servers. Apache 2 servers are *not* supported.
---++ Usage
To edit the attachments for a topic, open the topic in the TWiki. Open the application you want to use (e.g. MS Word), and drag the name of the attachment into the application.

At present you can only save back to the file you edited, or to another location (either a web folder or local folder).

Log messages may be generated in the apache error_log.
---++ Add-On Installation Instructions
__Note:__ You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this add-on. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the add-on on the server where TWiki is running. 

	* Install =tdb= (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdb/) and =TDB_File= (available from CPAN). You may well already have these installed.
	* Download the ZIP file from the Add-on Home (see below)
	* Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:
	| *File* | *Description* |
%$MANIFEST%

Unzip the zip over your TWiki installation. It won't break anything. To build and install the Apache module, follow the instructions on http://webdav.org/mod_dav/install.html

*Note that administrator access will usually be required to install the Apache module.*

To enable the TWiki-specific functions of twiki-dav, edit your =httpd.conf= and set up an appropriate Alias to point at your pub directory (see example below). Add a &lt;Location> section for your pub directory and add the following directives.
	* =DAV= is the standard DAV directive for enabling DAV on the directory.
	* =TWikiDir= defines the type of the directory (pub or data), and the absolute path to the directory after the URI has been resolved.
   * =TWikiScript- defines the path to the checkin script.
For example,
<verbatim>
Alias /twiki/dav/ /home/twiki/pub/
<Location /twiki/dav/>
   DAV On
   TWikiDir pub /home/twiki/pub
   TWikiScript /home/twiki/bin/dav.pl
   Options FollowSymLinks Indexes
   Allow from all
   # Obviously set your auth appropriately
   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "Enter your wiki username"
   AuthUserFile /home/twiki/.htpasswd
   Require valid-user
</Location>
</verbatim>
Restart the Apache server.

To configure the plugin, set the %TOPIC%_LOCK_DB variable below. Build your initial lock database by running the =recache.pl= script, which should have been installed in your twiki bin directory. This should build a lock database in the directory pointed at by =%%TOPIC%_LOCK_DB<nop>%=. Dump the content of this database using the =lib/TWiki/Plugins/WebDAVPlugin/davLockDB.pl= script. In a normal TWiki instllation this database will _not_ be empty.

To test the plugin, edit a topic in TWiki that should be controlled and put an access restriction in - for example, edit Sandbox.%TOPIC%Test and put in the lines:
<pre>
   * <nop>Set ALLOWTOPICVIEW = allowher
   * <nop>Set DENYTOPICVIEW = denyit
</pre>
Save the topic, dump the database again and grep for =Sandbox/%TOPIC%Test=. You should see two P: entries, one for ALLOW (:A) and one for DENY (:D).

The most likely reason for any problems is permissions; the DAVLockDB must be writable by the Apache user. Check the TWiki warning.txt file anthe Apache error logs.

Now attach an arbitrary file to that topic, preferably one associated with a WebDAV-enabled application e.g. a =.doc= file.

Open up the attachment directory using a WebDAV enabled application such as IE. If you used the example =Location= above, a URL such as =http<nop>://localhost/twiki/dav/Sandbox/%TOPIC%Test should work.

If you are not sure what applications are WebDAV enabled, just try typing a URL that uses the =Location= described above into the Open dialog until you find one that offers to let you save the file back to the URL, instead of to a local folder.

---++ Settings
	* *IMPORTANT* The following TWiki variable must be set to point to the same directory as your Apache DAVLockDB directive:
		* Set LOCK_DB = /var/lock/webdav
