The TWiki DAV integration consists of a mod_dav based Apache module and a bin script. The Apache module is based on mod_dav version 1.0.3 and includes all of the functionality of that module, so should be a drop-in replacement on Apache 1.3 servers. Apache 2 servers are *not* supported.

To build the module,

cd twiki_dav
./configure, make and make install following the instructions in INSTALL

edit your httpd.conf

in the <Directory> section for your pub directory put the following directives:

DAV On
TWiki <path to twiki>/bin/dav.pl pub

Add the following alias alongside the standard /twiki/ alias

Alias /twikiedit/ "/home/twiki/alpha/"

It _must_ be /twikiedit/, as the module uses that to recognise an edit request coming from the TWiki.


To edit the attachments for a topic, open the topic in the TWiki. Open the application you want to use (e.g. MS Word), and drag the name of the attachment into the application.

At present you can only save back to the file you edited, or to another location.

As with standard twiki, the pub directory is accessible to a GET by an authorised user i.e. TWiki protections are *not* honoured on attachments. twiki_dav does not have an opportunity to check the TWiki access permissions when a user drags and drops a URL into an application; access checks are _only_ performed when the file is saved back. Since the protections prevent the user browsing to the topic in the first place, this shouldn't be an issue.
