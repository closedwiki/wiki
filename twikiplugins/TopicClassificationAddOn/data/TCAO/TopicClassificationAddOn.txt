#AddOn
---+ Topic Classification Add-On 

<b> %TOPIC% (aka TCAO) helps you organize the content in your wiki by classifying topics according to their _function_ and/or _subject matter._ </b> It also provides a user-friendly interface for creating new topics that automatically incorporates this classification system. Together, these basic elements provide a platform that allow you to create any number of simple TWikiApplications.

Some of the features of %TOPIC% include:
   * See TCAO.TopicClassification for basic info.
   * CreateNewTopic "wizard"
   * Assigning parentage to new topics.
   * Display SubjectAreas trees using TopicTree

---++ Dependencies
TopicClassificationAddOn makes fairly extensive use of TWiki plugins. The only one that is _really_ essential is TWiki:Plugins.TopicCreatePlugin. It also requires ={EnableHierarchicalWebs}= to be enabled under in =configure= (under "Store settings" tab). TWiki:Plugins.TreePlugin is required for making use of the parentage-by-SubjectArea feature. TWiki:Plugins.TwistyPlugin is used by some of the pre-defined TopicTypes.
