%TOC%

%RED% This is the stripped down, rough draft of version 2.0 of %TOPIC%. The final version will have more detailed description of features and usage.%ENDCOLOR%
#AddOn
---+ Topic Classification Add-On 

<b> %TOPIC% (aka TCAO) helps you organize the content in your wiki by classifying topics according to their _function_ and/or _subject matter._ </b> It also provides a user-friendly interface for creating new topics that automatically incorporates this classification system. Together, these basic elements provide a platform that allow you to create any number of simple TWikiApplications.

Some of the features of %TOPIC% include:
   * See TCAO.TopicClassification for basic info.
   * CreateNewTopic "wizard"
   * Assigning parentage to new topics.
   * Display SubjectAreas trees using TopicTree
   * Ability to create completely alternative classification schemes.

---++ Dependencies
TopicClassificationAddOn makes fairly extensive use of TWiki plugins. These include:
   * 
   * TWiki:Plugins.DBCacheContrib
   * TWiki:Plugins.DBCachePlugin
   * TWiki:Plugins.TopicCreatePlugin
   * TWiki:Plugins.TreePlugin
   * TWiki:Plugins.IfDefinedPlugin
   * TWiki:Plugins.FilterPlugin
   * TWiki:Plugins.GluePlugin

It also requires ={EnableHierarchicalWebs}= to be enabled under in =configure= (under "Store settings" tab). 

---++ Add-On Installation Instructions

__Note:__ You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this add-on. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the add-on on the server where TWiki is running.

   1 Download the ZIP file from the Add-on Home (see below)
   1 Unpack the Add-on archive in the root of your TWiki installation.
   1 Add the following preference section to [[Main.TWikiPreferences]]:
<verbatim>
---++ TWiki.TopicClassificationAddOn Preferences 
   * TCAOWEB variable for identifying which web holds %TOPIC% infrastructure.
      * Set TCAOWEB = TCAO
      * Set HELP_BACKGROUND_COLOR = #E0B9A6
</verbatim>
   4 Go to %MAINWEB%.TWikiGroups and create a new group called ==ModeratorGroup==. This group can add new classifications within webs where TCAO is enabled.

---+++ Enabling %TOPIC% in a particular web

%TOPIC% is designed to organize content within individual webs. There are two options for enabling TopicClassificationAddOn in a particular web:
      * Create a new Web using the =_defaultTCAO= template web.
      * Use the TCAO installer form below to add the core TopicClassificationAddOn components to an existing web. (This won't show up until you've completed the above steps.)
%INCLUDE{"%TCAOWEB%.RenderInstallTopicClassification" warm="off"}%

---+++ Setting up Topic Classification within a web
Once %TOPIC% is enabled within a web, you're ready to start defining *TopicTypes* and *SubjectAreas* to be used in that web. To do this, go to those respective topics (e.g. go to !TopicType to add new !TopicTypes) and use form at bottom that is only visible to members of !ModeratorGroup (or %MAINWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup, of course).

TopicClassificationAddOn makes fairly extensive use of TWiki plugins. The only one that is _really_ essential is TWiki:Plugins.TopicCreatePlugin. It also requires ={EnableHierarchicalWebs}= to be enabled under in =configure= (under "Store settings" tab). TWiki:Plugins.TreePlugin is required for making use of the parentage-by-SubjectArea feature. TWiki:Plugins.TwistyPlugin is used by some of the pre-defined TopicTypes.

%RED% What follows is the "official TWiki add-on topic format that I has been posted on TWiki.org. For local discussion of on-going development of this add-on, see %TOPIC%Dev %ENDCOLOR%

<b> %TOPIC% (aka TCAO) helps you content in your wiki.  by classifying topics according to their _function_ and/or _subject matter._ </b> It also provides a user-friendly interface for creating new topics that automatically incorporates this classification system. Together, these basic elements provide a platform that allow you to create any number of simple TWikiApplications.

%TOPIC% organizes topics using two primary classifications:
   * *TopicTypes* group topics according to their __function or purpose.__ Some examples of <nop>TopicTypes include <nop>WebLog, <nop>MeetingNote, <nop>DiscussionTopic, or <nop>ReferenceNote. Oftentimes, <nop>TopicType have a characteristic structure which can be defined by a "[[TWiki.TWikiTemplates#Template_Topics][template topic]]".
   * *SubjectAreas* group topics according to __the subject matter__ of the topic. Examples might include <nop>FamilyAndFriends, <nop>WorldPolitics, <nop>WebDesign, or <nop>OpenSourceMovement. 

A special topic called *<nop>CreateNewTopic* provides a simple interface for creating new topics using this topic classification scheme and draws in special form elements relevant to the particular <nop>TopicType the user chooses from a drop-down menu. It also displays a list of all the topics of the particular <nop>TopicType the user selects to help reduce chances of creating two topics with nearly identical names.

The TopicClassificationAddOn installation includes some special topics which facilitate the creation of new <nop>TopicTypes and <nop>SubjectAreas and can serve as examples for developing your own classifications and simple TWiki:Codev.TWikiApplications. These include:
   * *<nop>TopicClassification* offers an overview of the TopicClassificationAddOn for the particular web in which it's used, including a list of all the <nop>TopicTypes and <nop>SubjectAreas.
   * *<nop>TopicTypeTemplate* that's automatically assigned to new <nop>TopicTypes. It includes ability to filter that <nop>TopicType but <nop>SubjectArea. For example, you could see all <nop>ReferenceTopics related to <nop>WebDesign.
   * Likewise there's a *<nop>SubjectAreaTemplate* that's assigned to new <nop>SubjectArea topics that offers ability to filter by <nop>TopicType.
   * One <nop>TopicType that is almost universally useful, <nop>ReferenceTopic, is included as an example <nop>TopicType.
   * A *<nop>WebFormWithClassification* topic that you can use as a template for your <nop>WebForm.
   * *<nop>TopicHeadline* explains this field that is used in <nop>WebFormWithClassification for displaying summaries of topics.

---++ Usage

   * The <nop>TopicClassification topic provides an entry-point for the topic classification system as applied in the particular web where it's installed.
   * The <nop>TopicType topic is really the core of the TopicClassificationAddOn. From here you can:
      * Define new <nop>TopicTypes using the "Create New <nop>TopicType" form near the bottom of the page. 
      * List your <nop>TopicTypes in a form at the beginning of the topic which populates the <nop>TopicType field in WebForm. Note: Since TWiki can not yet generate these forms dynamically, you need to manually add new <nop>TopicTypes to this form.
      * After you have created a new <nop>TopicType, there a a couple additional options for customizing how it's used:
         * On your new TopicType topic, notice there is link to define a template for that TopicType. If you create this template, any new topics you assign to this <nop>TopicType will automatically incorporate this template.
         * If you edit your new TopicType topic, you will see there are some hidden html-form elements. When you select this <nop>TopicType from the drop-down menu in <nop>CreateNewTopic, these form elements will be displayed there for additional user input. You can modify these or add new form elements to match the template for your new <nop>TopicType. For more information about how to insert data entered in an html-form into a TWiki topic template, see TWiki/TWikiTemplates#Template_Topics_in_Action.
   * <nop>SubjectAreas are actually just another <nop>TopicType, however they have special status as a secondary classification scheme. New <nop>SubjectAreas can be created from the <nop>CreateNewTopic topic.
   * The <nop>CreateNewTopic is used to, you guessed it, create new topics using the classification system. It includes a drop down menu of all the <nop>TopicTypes which, upon selecting a <nop>TopicType, will add any special form elements you have defined for that particular <nop>TopicType. If you place ==%<nop>INCLUDE{CreateNewTopic}%== within another topic or skin or navigation menu, it will display the same drop down menu of <nop>TopicTypes which, upon selecting a <nop>TopicType, will jump you to the <nop>CreateNewTopic topic with all the appropriate form elements for that <nop>TopicType displayed.

   * Test if the installation was successful:
      1 Go to <nop>TopicClassification within the web where you've unzipped the %TOPIC% archive. See if it lists the following <nop>TopicTypes: <nop>SubjectArea, <nop>TopicType, <nop>ReferenceTopic.
      1 *Important:* Go to <nop>WebFormWithClassification and edit WebForm to include pertinant elements from this template, or if there is no existing WebForm topic, simply rename this topic to WebForm. Make sure you have enabled the the WebForm in WebPreferences.
      1 Go to <nop>CreateNewTopic and create your first <nop>SubjectArea topic.
