Provide secure access (read and write [mysql only]) to data in a database allowing the user to specify the resulting output format as well as editable tables.  'secure', in this case, just means not putting passwords in clear text into a TWiki page but placing it either in a 'secure' flat TWiki file or in a database.

*NOTE:* <br>Security is _only_ achieved if:
	1 File ==bin/DatabasePluginConfig.pm== is not readable through a web page and has been _locked_ by updating the ==.htaccess== file in ==bin== (or locking via whatever your security procedure is on your web server)
	1 File ==bin/DatabasePluginEdit== has been _locked_ (requiring a valid user) by updating the ==.htaccess== file in ==bin== (or locking via whatever your security procedure is on your web server)
	1 People with login/ftp access to your web server do *not* have read access to ==bin/DatabasePluginConfig.pm==

This plugin references ==bin/DatabasePluginConfig.pm==.  This file contains one required section and one optional section.
	* *Required* - Description of where the primary DatabasePlugin database is located and
	* *Optional* - Any local database specific information if the above required section says that the _db_driver_ is ==Local==.

Again, this plugin provides access to database information in a semi-secure manner.  Since clear text passwords in a TWiki page is not good, the passwords to databases are themselves placed into a DatabasePlugin database (either located in a real database or located in the ==bin/DatabasePluginConfig.pm== file).  This database contains the following fields:
	| *Column Name* | *Description* |
	| ID | Standard auto_increment column to allow for unique db entries (optional if a real database) |
	| description | This field acts as the look-up mechanism for the indirection.  A TWiki page would reference this name instead of having to publicly specify user names, passwords, etc. |
	| driver | Database driver name (currently only =mysql= has been tested) |
	| db_name | The name of the database in which the =table_name= is found |
	| db_sid | The SID of the database in which the =table_name= is found (optional: used for Oracle) |
	| table_name | The name of the table found in the =db_name= database |
	| ro_username | A user name providing read-only access to the specified table |
	| ro_password | The password for the specified =ro_username= |
	| hostname | The name of the host on which the specified =db_name= lives |

To secure the database information allowing access to the above database, a Perl .pm is created and placed into =bin= where the ==.htaccess== file (or whatever your security mechanism is) is updated such that this file can NOT be viewed from a web browser.  This file contains variables defining access information to the above database. The variables are:
	| $db_driver | DBI driver -- Tested values are: *mysql*, *Oracle*, and *Local* (where *Local* means instead of the indirection into the database to get the further database information the info is obtained locally) |
	| $db_database | The name of the database in which the table described above can be found |
	| $db_sid | The SID of the database in which the table described above can be fond (optional: used for Oracle) |
	| $db_table | The table in which the above information is found.  I used =DatabasePlugin= as the table name, though you can specify anything you wish |
	| $db_username | The user name allowing access to the above database (for both read and write access) |
	| $db_password | The password allowing $db_username access to the table (for both read and write access) |
	| $db_hostname | The hostname on which the above table can be found |
	| $db_edit_prefix | The prefix used when generating the URL for invoking phpMyAdmin.  The value of this by default is 'https' for added security, though could be set to 'http' |
	| $db_edit_url | The rest of the URL which points to phpMyAdmin.  This can either be a relative path or absolute.  If absolute, then the form would look something like =machine.do.main/path_to_where_phpMyAdmin_can_be_found= |

---++ Example

Assume that the =DatabasePluginConfig.pm= file (locked away in =bin= so that a user can not view the contents) contains the following:

<verbatim>
$db_driver      = "Oracle";
$db_database    = "mydb";
$db_sid         = "sid";
$db_table       = "DatabasePlugin";
$db_username    = "user";
$db_password    = "123456"; # (Note: this is the clear text password)
$db_hostname    = "localhost";
</verbatim>

Assume that the database specified above contains the following information:
	| *ID* | *description* | *driver* | *db_name* | *table_name* | *ro_username* | *ro_password* | *hostname* |
	| 1 | calendar_events | mysql | mydb | kalendus_event | username1 | password1 | localhost |
	| 2 | mysql_user_info | mysql | mysql | user | username2 | password2 | localhost |

Now if I have the following in a TWiki page and the DatabasePlugin installed, the results should be a table containing 4 columns of information.

&#37;DATABASE_TABLE{description="mysql_user_info" columns="Host,User,Password,Select_priv"}%

If I want table column headings that differ from the database column names, I could use:
&#37;DATABASE_TABLE{description="mysql_user_info" columns="Host,User,Password,Select_priv" headers="Host Name,User Name, Password,Select Privs"}%

An optional way to do the same thing would be to use:
&#37;DATABASE_SQL_TABLE{description="mysql_user_info" command="SELECT Host,User,Password,Select_priv FROM user" headers="Host Name,User Name, Password,Select Privs"}%

Using the REPEAT functionality, you can define how the database data is displayed wrapping it in any formatting you choose.  For example, if you wanted to create a single table cell containing the information for 3 fields of the Kalendus calendar, you could use the following:
&#37;DATABASE_REPEAT{description="calendar_events"}%| %startdate%<BR>%subject%<BR>%body% |
%DATABASE_REPEAT%

Or lets say you wanted to display the next two upcoming scheduled events in the Kalendus calendar.
&#37;DATABASE_SQL_REPEAT{description="calendar_events" command="SELECT subject,body,startdate FROM kalendus_event WHERE to_days(startdate) >= to_days(now()) order by startdate limit 2"}%| %startdate%<BR>%subject%<BR>%body% |
%DATABASE_SQL_REPEAT%

Now lets say that you wanted to give the user the ability to edit the contents of a table.  NOTE: This feature assumes the availability of phpMyAdmin since it uses phpMyAdmin to provide table editing.  The following is how you would edit the table described by _calendar_events_.
&#37;DATABASE_EDIT{description="calendar_events" display_text="Edit the above table"}%

	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0

	* Set security mode (0 = allow viewing of the contents of the master DatabasePlugin database, 1 = don't allow viewing of the master database)
	* Set SECURITY = 1
	* Set SECURITY_MESSAGE = <font color=red>Error: For security reasons, you can't specify the main DatabasePlugin database since it contains clear text passwords.</font>

---+++ Plugin Installation Instructions

	* Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below)
	* Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:
	  | *File:* | *Description:* |
