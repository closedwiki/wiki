---+ NewsPlugin v1.4

The News plugin implements a simple "Headlines" view, or summary, of a list of news
or a weblog.
One enters news as items of a bulleted list in a single topic, most recent first. If somewhere in the topic, the keyword <b>%NEWS%</b> appears, then a new topic is created (by default of the name of the topic with =Headlines= appended) with the first line of the 5 more recent news.
Ending punctuation is removed from the headlines for a sleeker look.

Recommended usage is to INCLUDE this generated topic in some panel in a front page,
and put a "More..." link in it to the original <tt>MyCompanyNews</tt> topic.
The =%<nop>NEWS%= variable can be set in an HTML comment: 
<br> =&lt;!-- %<nop>NEWS% -->=

It needs a TWiki version of 01 Feb 2003 or better, or the 01 Dec 2001 version with the
TWiki:Codev/PluginHookOnSavePatch patch.

---++ Syntax Rules

Add a =%<nop>NEWS%= variable in a news topic named *Xxx* to generate a headline topic
named *Xxx<nop>Headlines*.

To change the default, use the syntax =%<nop>NEWS{parameter="value" ...}%= syntax
with the following available parameters:
| *Parameter* | *Value* |
| count | The number of headlines to keep. Defaults to 5. |
| prefix | This text will be prepended to the generated topic. Defaults to nothing. |
| suffix | This text will be appended to the generated topic. Defaults to nothing. |
| presep | Prepend each headline with this text. Defaults to =&lt;tab>*&lt;space>= |
| postsep | Appends this text to each headline. Defaults to =newline= |
| trim | If set to "no", trailings punctuation marks ( =.,:;= ) are note removed from headlines. defaults to "yes" |

Example: 
=%<nop>NEWS{presep="&lt;li>" prefix="&lt;ul>" suffix="&lt;/ul>"}%=

---++ Examples

Example: If the topic <tt>MyCompanyNews</tt> contains:
<pre style='background:#ffffe0; border:solid; width=80%; border-width: thin;'>
%<nop>NEWS%
	<nop>* NewsPlugin released - 18 Feb 2003.
	The great news plugin has been debugged
	<nop>* NewsPlugin devel started - 02 Jan 2003.
	I think this is really needed, 
	I will try to keep it simple
</pre>
Then on saving the topic <tt>MyCompanyNewsHeadlines</tt> will contain:
<pre style='background:#ffffe0; border:solid; width=80%; border-width: thin;''>
	<nop>* NewsPlugin released - 18 Feb 2003
	<nop>* NewsPlugin devel started - 02 Jan 2003
</pre>
