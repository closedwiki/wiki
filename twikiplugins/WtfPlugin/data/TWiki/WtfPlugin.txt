---+!! Wtf Plugin

*This is not an end user plugin; it is intended for plugins authors only.*

This plugin is designed to help plugins authors understand the sequence of calls to the different plugin functions. It builds a list of called functions that can then be interrogated. It is also useful to help understand what is going on under accelerators like =mod_perl=.

%TOC%
---+ Features
Builds a log of calls to plugin functions over the lifetime of a plugin.

---+ Syntax Rules

The TWiki variable =WTF= will be expanded to the list of calls if you have followed the instructions correctly. If the plugin is already installed, you will see a list of calls embedded below.

  $tmpl =~ s/%WTF%/&TWiki::Plugins::WtfPlugin::wtfReport()/ge;

---+ Settings
	* Description:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Review plugin call sequence
	* Switch - set to 0 to disable plugin
		* Set ACTIVE = 1

---+ Plugin Installation Instructions
These installation instructions apply to TWiki versions later than Nov 2003. If you want to install with an earlier version the plugin should work, but you'll have to do step 3 differently.
	* Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below)
	* Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:
	| *File:* | *Description:* |
%$MANIFEST%
	* Edit your =lib/TWiki/UI/View.pm= and locate the following lines:
<verbatim>
# print page content
print $tmpl
</verbatim>
Immediately before these lines, add the following line:
<verbatim>
$tmpl =~ s/%WTF%/&TWiki::Plugins::WtfPlugin::wtfReport()/ge;
</verbatim>
Then when you add %WTF% to a topic it will be expanded at the last possible minute in the view process to the list of plugin calls. Similar tricks can be played with the other scripts, like =Preview.pm=.
