*This contrib packages in a convenient way the !JavaScript library and the CSS file needed to implement Twisty sections.*

!TwistyContrib is installed by default in TWiki 4 and used by [[TWiki:Plugins.TwistyPlugin][Twisty Plugin]].

It is recommended to use the !TwistyPlugin as it eases the deployment and use of this contrib.

This Contrib should work in all versions of TWiki. It has been tested against [[TWiki:Codev.CairoRelease][TWiki 3]] and [[TWiki:Codev.DakarRelease][TWiki 4]].

---++ Usage examples

If the contrib is properly installed (and !JavaScript is enabled in your browser) you should see two folding sections below.

---+++ Basic Twisty
<verbatim>
<span id="demo1show" class="twistyTrigger twistyMakeVisible"><button class="twikiButton"> Unfold </button></span>
<span id="demo1hide" class="twistyTrigger twistyHidden"><button class="twikiButton"> Fold </button></span>
<span id="demo1toggle" class="twistyContent twistyMakeHidden">
my twisty content
</span>
</verbatim>

Generates:

<span id="demo1show" class="twistyTrigger twistyMakeVisible"><button class="twikiButton"> Unfold </button></span>
<span id="demo1hide" class="twistyTrigger twistyHidden"><button class="twikiButton"> Fold </button></span>
<span id="demo1toggle" class="twistyContent twistyMakeHidden">
my twisty content
</span>

---+++ Twisty with placeholder text
<verbatim>
<span id="demo2show" class="twistyTrigger twistyMakeVisible"><a href="#">Expand...</a> <span class="twistyPlaceholder">Hamlet is without question the most famous play in the English language...</span></span>
<span id="demo2hide" class="twistyTrigger twistyHidden"><a href="#">Collapse...</a></span>
<span id="demo2toggle" class="twistyContent twistyMakeHidden">
Hamlet is without question the most famous play in the English language. Probably written in 1601 or 1602, the tragedy is a milestone in Shakespeare's dramatic development.
</span>
</verbatim>

Generates:

<span id="demo2show" class="twistyTrigger twistyMakeVisible"><a href="#">Expand...</a> <span class="twistyPlaceholder">Hamlet is without question the most famous play in the English language...</span></span>
<span id="demo2hide" class="twistyTrigger twistyHidden"><a href="#">Collapse...</a></span>
<span id="demo2toggle" class="twistyContent twistyMakeHidden">
Hamlet is without question the most famous play in the English language. Probably written in 1601 or 1602, the tragedy is a milestone in Shakespeare's dramatic development.
</span>

Skins can customize the color of the twisty placeholder by modifiying the =.twistyPlaceholder= style.

---++ Twisty made easy

Manual written by [[TWiki:Main.HaraldJoerg][Harald Joerg]]. Examples require [[TWiki:Plugins.SpreadsheetPlugin][Spreadsheet Plugin]] to work (installed by default).

<blockquote>
Some of my TWiki users are impressed by the optical effect of what can be done with TWiki:Plugins.TwistyPlugin - and they keep asking me: "How do I do that? I don't understand the documentation, and I don't understand the raw text of your topics!"

They indeed have a point here.  The docs aren't easily understood.  It isn't easy to pick all the variables needed from a single example, and just copypasting sometimes fails in embarrassing ways if non-unique =id= attributes are present in a topic.  Maybe it is easy for a power user, but it surely isn't easy _enough_.  There _ought_ to be a way to make it easier.

Well, here you are.

Just set a couple of site preferences, and your users will immediately understand your examples and start writing their own twisties.  And what's more: They'll do so in a _consistent_ way, across all your topics in all webs.
</blockquote>

---+++ You Write 
In your !Main.TWikiPreferences write:
<verbatim>
   * Set FLIP = <span id="twid_%CALC{$SETM(twisty_id, + 1)$GET(twisty_id)}%show" class="twistyTrigger twistyMakeVisible">
       <a href="#">more...</a>
     </span>
     <span id="twid_%CALC{$GET(twisty_id)}%hide" class="twistyTrigger twistyHidden">
       <a href="#">close</a>
     </span>
     <div id="twid_%CALC{$GET(twisty_id)}%toggle" class="twistyContent twistyMakeHidden">
   * Set FLOP = </div>
</verbatim>
%T% You can include the text in a verbatim block if you want (like I have done here).
Additionally I've added plenty of newlines and spaces to make it readable.
This works, and you don't have to care for invalid HTML!

---+++ Your Users Write
In any topic, your users can now write things like this:
<verbatim>
   * *Brace and parenthesize in K&R style* 
     %FLIP% 
     When setting out a code block, use the K&R style of bracketing.  
     That is, place the opening brace at the end of the construct that controls the block. ... 
     %FLOP%
   * *Separate your control keywords from the following opening bracket* 
     %FLIP% 
     Control structures regulate the dynamic behaviour of a program, so the keywords 
     of control structures are the most critical components of a program. ... 
     %FLOP%
</verbatim>
