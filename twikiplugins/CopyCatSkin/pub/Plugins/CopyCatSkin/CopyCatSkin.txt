---+ the Copy Cat Skin

...is not really a skin per se, rather it is (will be)  a collection of partially built skins modelled after other popular sites on the net.

---++ Movable Type
To kick things off, atached is a Codev.MovableType look alike: ==cc-moveabletype== .To install, 
	* put the download archive in =$twikiroot=
	* unzip, with directories (will put files in =templates/= , =pub/Plugins/CopyCatSkin/= , =data/Plugins/=)
	* edit TWiki.TWikiPreferences, WebPreferences, or your personal page and set the variables
<verbatim>
		* Set SKIN = cc-movabletype
		* Set CCSTYLE = mt-georgia-blue
</verbatim>

To try out the different looks available, substitute _georgia-blue_ with any of the css files in =pub/Plugins/CopyCatSkin/= . The twiki template uses the same class and id names as the default Moveable Type template. You should be able to put any MT template into /pub/Plugins/CopyCatSkin, update the CCSTYLE variable, and it will just work. No edits necessary.

I built this skin as a proof of concept and don't intend to maintain or extend it. Only the view template is defined. Anybody who wants to take it over is welcome to.
