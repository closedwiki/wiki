Automates build and packaging process, including installer generation, for TWiki extension modules.

---+ Summary of Contents
---++ Build & Install Modules
This module can be used to create a really simple build process for your TWiki extension. It is inspired by the Java ANT build tool developed by the Apache project, but is targeted specifically at building TWiki.

The module is used for TWiki release builds, and optionally for building TWiki extensions as well. The advantage of using the module is that it dictates a standard build procedure for extensions, which reduces the chances of something going wrong, and makes your extension easier for you, and others, to maintain and extend. Further, if you use this build approach, your module can easily be included into other build scripts, for example for creating collections of plugins.

The module can also automatically generate an installer script that simplifies end-user installation.

Also included is a wizard script (=twikiplugins/create-new-extension.pl=) for creating a new extension in the TWiki source tree.

The !BuildContrib is not just used for building code modules. It can also be used to package !TWikiApplications, and even pure documentation packages.

__Notes__
   * This is a _build and packaging_ module for use by _developers_, *not* an _install_ module for _end users_ (though it does _build_ an installer script, among other things).
   * The module has *only been tested on Linux*, but *should* work with Cygwin OK.
   * !BuildContrib has *only been tested with TWiki-4*. It *should* work with earlier TWiki versions.
#DevelopmentModel
---+++ Development Model
The build module assumes:
   1 that you are *not* developing your plugin in a 'live' TWiki installation (something that is usually a really bad idea), but are instead doing the sensible thing and developing in a separate directory tree, usually - but not always - a Subversion checkout area.
   1 that your module follows the standards for extensions i.e. that it
      1 has a *topic* named the same as the extension in the =data/TWiki= directory (e.g. =data/TWiki/MyContrib.txt=)
      1 has a perl module (.pm file) in the =lib/TWiki/Plugins= or =lib/TWiki/Contrib= directory (e.g. =lib/TWiki/Contrib/MyContrib.pm=)
      1 has a sub-directory in the same place  (e.g. =lib/TWiki/Contrib/MyContrib/) that contains the build scripts and any extra =.pm= files specific to the module

Each individual extension has its own build script, usually called =build.pl=.
For example, assuming you are working in a Subversion checkout area (*strongly* recommended), the development cycle for a new Plugin looks like this. 
   1 Create your plugin source tree under =twikiplugins=
      * =cd twikiplugins; perl create-new-extension.pl MyNewPlugin=
   1 Edit =.pm= files as required to create your plugin functionality
   1 =cd twikiplugins/MyPlugin/lib/TWiki/Plugins/MyPlugin; perl build.pl release= to build a release package and installer
   1 Unzip and install<sup>%RED%1%ENDCOLOR%</sub> the built package in your *test* system (which may be your development system, or may be another TWiki install altogether)
   1 Repeat from step 2 until it works
   1 =cd twikiplugins/MyPlugin/lib/TWiki/Plugins/MyPlugin; perl build.pl upload= to upload the module to TWiki.org<sup>%RED%*2%ENDCOLOR%</sub>
<sup>%RED%1%ENDCOLOR%</sub> if you are working in Subversion, then you can use the =pseudo-install.pl= script to simplify this install step
<sup>%RED%*2%ENDCOLOR%</sub> or other repository of your choice e.g. local company plugins repository

The build script is rather like a =Makefile=. It has several _targets_ that can be used to perform different stages of the development cycle. By default these targets are:
| =build= | check that everything is perl |
| =test= | run unit tests |
| =installer= | Build an install/uninstall script for use by end-users |
| =pod= | build POD documentation |
| =release= | =build=, =installer=, =pod=, and package a release zip |
| =upload= | =release= and upload to twiki.org |
| =manifest= | _print_ a best-guess _draft_ MANIFEST file |
| =history= | _update_ the plugin/contrib topic with the history extracted from Subversion. See #HistoryTarget for more information. |
The default target is =test=.

The module is designed so that most common behaviour is catered for. It is also easy to _override_ any of the default targets in your =build.pl= and add extra behaviours.

The results of the 'release' target are four files: a Zip format archive, a gzipped tar archive, an md5 checksum, and the extension topic. The archives will each contain the following:
   1 All the files listed in the =MANIFEST=
   1 An install/uninstall script, that is can be run after the module is unpacked

__Notes__
   * When a release is built, an installer/uninstaller script is automatically generated that is packaged with the release. This simple script is the only part of the build system visible to end users
   * This topic, and all the embedded POD documentation, are generated using this build module.
   * The build environment does _not_ assume the use of Subversion, though it is highly recommended.
   * The =test= target assumes you are using Test::Unit.

---+++ Install support
The installer script shipped with the package is very simple. By default all it does is to check the dependencies you list, and if necessary download and install any missing TWiki and CPAN modules. Other dependencies are simply checked. In TWiki-4.0 and later releases, TWiki topics shipped with the module are automatically merged into any existing local copies, ensuring histories are preserved.

If you want your installer to do anything else - for example, optionally build submodules shipped with the module - then you will need to write a =POSTINSTALL= script. See #InstallScripts for more information.

|  8583 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item1527'>Item1527</a>  Generated install scripts now really attaches files in pub to topics (means less of these couldn't update history error messages) |
|  8581 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item1527'>Item1527</a>  BuildContrib: Execute topic saves in the TWiki web as TWikiAdminGroup by default |

|  7207 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item437'>Item437</a>  Revised BuildContrib to build MD5s. Crawford - feel free to ditch anything you don't like. (I sent you email about this a couple of days ago). MD5 files are generated for each package and then aggregated during a hands-off install to collect all dependent MD5s into package/DEPS.md5 |
|  6827 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item569'>Item569</a>  added default RELEASE to everything that had a version, and removed a load of dead code that was getting in the way |

|  6369 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item384'>Item384</a>  As excellent as Antonio's solution is, it breaks all the save script tests and is incompatible with previous releases. Need to fall back on the old 'action' parameter if the new parameters are not available - even though it is really bad news (it blocks the use of 'action' as a form-field name :-(. Also updated the script documentation for Antonio's changes. |
|  6353 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item380'>Item380</a>  do as the man says; make all $/ local |
|  6240 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item196'>Item196</a>  Extracted the Manifest File processing from Build.pm to a module that can be used by other Build implementations. Needed for a CommandSet of TWikiShellContrib |
|  6092 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item196'>Item196</a>  more plugin and contrib fixes for develop; mainly just moving tests around and making sure they all pass. |
|  6077 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item243'>Item243</a>  simplified gendocs to stop it generating ,v files, since Sven is going to solve that. Coorected MANIFEST for source code documents. |
|  6076 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item243'>Item243</a>  added build scripts for all plugins shipped with TWikiForGenericUse |
|  6068 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item244'>Item244</a>  extracted target_stage and target_archive from target_release to allow me to add functionality to target_stage |
|  6051 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item237'>Item237</a>  removed requirement to set TWIKI_LIBS for core build |
|  6040 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item237'>Item237</a>  now supports automatic instantiation of plugins and contribs in the release tree. Install scripts are _not_ run. |
|  6039 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item237'>Item237</a>  MANIFEST build based on BuildContrib. Very few extensions to BuildContrib were required to do it. Things that are missing are: 1. generation of ,v files 2. packaging up and inclusion of plugins. |
|  6026 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item229'>Item229</a>  added support for sub-headings in =configure=. Added support for adding comments to LocalSite.cfg to BuildContrib. Can now create sections in =configure= for individual plugins. |
|  5960 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item181'>Item181</a>  new version, supports DEVELOP and Cairo, and adds support for attachments (you can now mail attachments to topics) |
