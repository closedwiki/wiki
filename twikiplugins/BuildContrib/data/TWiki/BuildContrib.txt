---+ Summary of Contents
---++ Build & Install Modules
This module can be used by developers to create a really simple build process for your plugin, addon or contrib module. It is inspired by the Java ANT build tool developed by the Apache project, but is targeted specifically at building TWiki and TWiki extensions.

The module is used for TWiki release builds, and optionally for building TWiki extensions as well. The advantage of using the module is that it dictates a standard build procedure for extensions (such as plugins), so you won't get file names wrong or get the list of files in the topic wrong either. Further, if you use this build approach, your module can easily be included into other build scripts, for example for creating collections of plugins.

The module can also automatically generate an installer script that simplifies end-user installation.

__Notes__
   * This is a _build_ module for use by _developers_, *not* an _install_ module for _end users_.

#DevelopmentModel
---+++ Development Model
The build module assumes:
   1 that you are *not* developing your plugin in a 'live' TWiki installation (which would be a really bad idea), but are instead doing the sensible thing and developing in a separate directory tree, usually - but not always - a Subversion checkout area.
   1 that your module follows the standards for extensions i.e. that it
      1 has a topic named the same as the extension in the =data/TWiki= directory
      1 has a perl module in the =lib/TWiki/Plugins= or =lib/TWiki/Contrib= directory
      1 has a sub-directory alongside the perl module that contains the extra =.pm= files specific to the module
The module also supports optional separation of your *development*, *module test*, and *integration test* TWiki installations. You can do all three steps in a single install, or you can use three separate installs for the three steps if you want to be particularly thorough.

Each individual extension has its own build script, usually called =build.pl=. This script uses the !BuildContrib libraries to build the extension.
For example, assuming you are working in a Subversion checkout area (*strongly* recommended), the development cycle for a new Plugin looks like this. 
   1 Create your plugin area under =twikiplugins=
      * =cd twikiplugins; perl create-new-plugin.pl MyNewPlugin=
   1 Edit files to create your plugin functionality
   1 =cd twikiplugins/MyPlugin/lib/TWiki/Plugins/MyPlugin; perl build.pl release= to build a release package and installer
   1 Unzip and install the built package in your *test* system (which may be your development system, or may be another TWiki install altogether)
   1 Repeat from step 2 until it works
   1 =cd twikiplugins/MyPlugin/lib/TWiki/Plugins/MyPlugin; perl build.pl upload= to upload the module to TWiki.org

The build script is rather like a Makefile. It has several _targets_ that can be used to perform different stages of the development cycle. By default these targets are:
| =build= | check that everything is perl |
| =test= | run unit tests |
| =installer= | Build an install/uninstall script for use by end-users |
| =pod= | build POD documentation |
| =release= | =build=, =installer=, =pod=, and package a release zip |
| =upload= | =release= and upload to twiki.org |
| =manifest= | _print_ a best-guess _draft_ MANIFEST file |
| =history= | _update_ the plugin/contrib topic with the history extracted from Subversion. See #HistoryTarget for more information. |
The default target is =test=.

The module is designed so that most common behaviour is catered for. It is also easy to _override_ any of the default targets in your =build.pl= and add extra behaviours.

The results of the 'release' target are three files: a Zip format archive, a gzipped tar archive, and an md5 checksum. The archives will each contain the following:
   1 All the files listed in the =MANIFEST=
   1 An install/uninstall script, that is can be run after the module is unpacked

__Notes__
   * When a release is built, an installer/uninstaller script is automatically generated that is packaged with the release. This simple script is the only part of the build system visible to end users
   * This topic, and all the embedded POD documentation, are generated using this build module.
   * The build environment does _not_ assume the use of Subversion, though it is highly recommended.
   * The =test= target assumes you are using Test::Unit.
   * =Build.pm= has only been tested on Linux, but should work with cygwin OK.
---+++ Install support
The installer script shipped with the package is very simple. By default all it does is to check the dependencies you list, and if necessary download and install any missing TWiki and CPAN modules. Other dependencies are simply checked. In Dakar and later releases, TWiki topics shipped with the module are automatically merged into any existing local copies, ensuring histories are preserved.

If you want your installer to do anything else - for example, optionally install submodules shipped with the module - then you will need to write a =POSTINSTALL= script. See #InstallScripts for more information.

---++ Support scripts
=conformance_analyser.pl= is a perl script that analyses the conformance of plugins to the API and packaging standards. It is driven from the archives downloadable from twiki.org.

|  8583 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item1527'>Item1527</a>  Generated install scripts now really attaches files in pub to topics (means less of these couldn't update history error messages) |
|  8581 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item1527'>Item1527</a>  BuildContrib: Execute topic saves in the TWiki web as TWikiAdminGroup by default |

|  7207 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item437'>Item437</a>  Revised BuildContrib to build MD5s. Crawford - feel free to ditch anything you don't like. (I sent you email about this a couple of days ago). MD5 files are generated for each package and then aggregated during a hands-off install to collect all dependent MD5s into package/DEPS.md5 |
|  6827 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item569'>Item569</a>  added default RELEASE to everything that had a version, and removed a load of dead code that was getting in the way |

|  6369 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item384'>Item384</a>  As excellent as Antonio's solution is, it breaks all the save script tests and is incompatible with previous releases. Need to fall back on the old 'action' parameter if the new parameters are not available - even though it is really bad news (it blocks the use of 'action' as a form-field name :-(. Also updated the script documentation for Antonio's changes. |
|  6353 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item380'>Item380</a>  do as the man says; make all $/ local |
|  6240 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item196'>Item196</a>  Extracted the Manifest File processing from Build.pm to a module that can be used by other Build implementations. Needed for a CommandSet of TWikiShellContrib |
|  6092 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item196'>Item196</a>  more plugin and contrib fixes for develop; mainly just moving tests around and making sure they all pass. |
|  6077 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item243'>Item243</a>  simplified gendocs to stop it generating ,v files, since Sven is going to solve that. Coorected MANIFEST for source code documents. |

|  6051 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item237'>Item237</a>  removed requirement to set TWIKI_LIBS for core build |
|  6040 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item237'>Item237</a>  now supports automatic instantiation of plugins and contribs in the release tree. Install scripts are _not_ run. |
|  6039 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item237'>Item237</a>  MANIFEST build based on BuildContrib. Very few extensions to BuildContrib were required to do it. Things that are missing are: 1. generation of ,v files 2. packaging up and inclusion of plugins. |
|  6026 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item229'>Item229</a>  added support for sub-headings in =configure=. Added support for adding comments to LocalSite.cfg to BuildContrib. Can now create sections in =configure= for individual plugins. |
|  5960 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item181'>Item181</a>  new version, supports DEVELOP and Cairo, and adds support for attachments (you can now mail attachments to topics) |
