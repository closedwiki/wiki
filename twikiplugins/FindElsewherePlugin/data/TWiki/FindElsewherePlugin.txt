---++ Find Elsewhere Plugin

This plugin will automatically link to another web(s) if a topic isn't found in the current web.  

This is useful for a TWiki site that wants to implement a glossar/dictionary web where common terms are defined and stored.  Without this plugin:
	* Each web would need to create their own topic for a common term 
	* Link to or INCLUDE the topic from where it is defined
	* Authors need to remember to put the Web name in front of the topic name, such as [[TWiki.WikiWord]]

Without this kind of plugin, it's likely that common terms used within an organization will be defined in multiple webs or the common terms will be unlinked wiki words (as if they didn't exist).

---+++ Syntax Rules
No new rules are introduced.  However, new automatic TWiki.WikiWord linking will occur.  

If a topic is not found in the current web, this plugin will look in the LOOKELSEWHERE web list for that topic.  If and when the topic is found as it looks through the webs in their listed order, it will create a link to that page using either the [<nop>[ ]] syntax or the standard syntax, according to the value of the SHOWWEBNAME preference variable described below.

---+++ <nop>%TOPIC% Settings

	* One line description, is shown in the %TWIKIWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = If a topic isn't found in this web it will look in a predefined list of other webs and attempt to find it there.  

	* List other webs in which to look for topics that don't exist
		* Set LOOKELSEWHERE = TWiki, Main

	* If it shows the full topic name with (default) or without (=0) the web name
		* Set SHOWWEBNAME = 0

	* If the TWiki.WikiWord is plural but doesn't exist, also look for the singular word.  Note this setting is for looking in *other* webs only (plural to singular is still automatically done in the current web).
		* Set PLURALTOSINGULAR = 1

	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0
