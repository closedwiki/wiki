LocalTimePlugin is kind-of rewrite of LocalCityTimePlugin. I was unsatisfied with LocalCityTimePlugin (it has to connect to an external site to get the local time for a given city), so I wrote this Plugin to use the system's localtime functions. It works rather well, but doesn't do too much checking right now for a valid code. It won't die horribly if you give it a bad code, it just will give you a random time.

I use it for our systems diary here. Works quite well.

---++ Syntax Rules

Add a %<nop>LOCALTIME% tag to your text to show the current time. You can specify the location or timezone such as "Asia/Tokyo" or "GMT" with %<nop>LOCALTIME{location}%, where _location_ is a location mentioned on http://www.bsdi.com/xdate/, or a timezone code such as "JST".

---++ Examples

	* Time in Tokyo now: %<nop>LOCALTIME{Asia/Tokyo}%
	* Time in London now: %<nop>LOCALTIME{Europe/London}%

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Global Settings
