---++!! Action Tracker Plugin

This plugin provides support for action tracking and notification in meeting minutes. It can also be used for private reminders, for example TODO lists and diary entries. _( Discussion in TWiki:Plugins/ActionTrackerPluginDev )_

%TOC%

---++ Features

	* Action tags may be added to TWiki topics that will be displayed formatted in-line.
	* Actions in a web can also be listed using searches.
	* A script is provided for automatic action notification.
	* Actions can be assigned to individuals, or to predefined groups of individuals.

---++ Syntax Rules

---+++ Actions

Write the command =%<nop>ACTION{ attributes }%= anywhere in a TWiki topic. All the text following the final % up to the next end-of-line is taken as the action description. Standard attributes are
	| *Name* | *Value* | *Description* |
	| =who= | a wiki name, or an e-mail address | The person or team responsible for completing the action |
	| =due= | A valid date as understood by Time::ParseDate | The due date |
	| =state= | "open" or "closed" | Set to "open" if the action is still open;<br />Set to "closed" if the action is closed |
	| =notify= | A comma-separated list | wiki names, or e-mail addresses, of people to notify when the date, state or text of the action changes. |
	| =creator= | Who created the action. |
	| =created= | Date the action was created |
	| =closed= | Date the action was closed, if ever, and who closed it |
	| =uid= | Unique ID of the action (auto-generated) |
For example,
<pre>
%<nop>ACTION{ who="TWikiGuest" due="2 Jan 2004" state="open" notify="AttillaTheHun" }% An action for TWikiGuest
</pre>
The fields =who=, =creator=, =created=, =closed= and =uid= are auto-generated when you first save the topic containing the action. =who= and =creator= default to the name of the person doing the saving. You can override this behaviour by providing values for any of these attributes when you type the action.

#ArbitraryAttributes
---++++ Arbitrary Attributes
As well as the standard attributes you can add arbitrary non-standard attributes to actions, and use them in searches. For example:
<pre>
%<nop>ACTION{ who="EmperorHadrian" due="1 Jan 0053" state="closed" legion="7th" cohort="6th" maniple="3rd" }% Build a wall to keep the Scots out of England
</pre>

#DateFormats
---++++ Date formats
The following absolute date formats are recognised. Dates containing spaces must be enclosed in double-quotes.
	* Dow, dd Month yy
	* Dow, dd Month yyyy
	* Dow, dd Month
	* dd Month yy
	* dd Month yyyy
	* Month day{st,nd,rd,th}, year
	* Month dd yyyy
	* yyyy/mm/dd
	* yyyy/mm
	* mm/dd/yy
	* mm/dd/yyyy
	* mm/yy
	* yy/mm		(only if year > 12)
	* yy/mm/dd	(only if year > 12 and day < 32)

You are *strongly* recommended never to use the 'mm/dd/yyyy or mm/dd/yyyy' formats, to avoid confusing users in Europe (like me).

---+++ Action searches

Write the command =%<nop>ACTIONSEARCH{ attributes }%= anywhere in a TWiki topic. Standard attributes are
	| *Name* | *Value* | *Description* |
	| who | a wiki name or an e-mail address, or 'me' for the currently logged-in user (this is 'TWikiGuest' unless you have been prompted for a username and password) | The name of the person responsible |
	| notify | same as =who= | Persons who want to be notified of a change |
	| state | "late", "open" or "closed" | Set to "late" to search for late actions;<br /> Set to "open" to search for open actions;<br /> Set to "closed" to search for closed actions |
	| within | a number of days | Search for actions that are within a number of days of their due date |
	| web | Perl regular expression | A regular expression that matches the names of all the webs to search. If this attribute is omitted, the default is to search only the current web. Searching many webs is much slower, especially in a large installation. Webs marked NOSEARCHALL will not be searched. | 
	| topic | Perl regular expression | A regular expression that matches the names of all the topics to search. If this attribute is omitted, the default is to search all the topics in the selected webs. | 
	| format | Presentation format | See #FormattingActions |
	| header | Presentation format | See #FormattingActions |
	| sort | Comma-separated list of field names to sort the matched actions by. For example, <code>sort="$who,$due"</code> will sort by who first and then due. This field is optional; by default the table will be sorted by due date. |
For example,
<pre>
%<nop>ACTIONSEARCH{ who="me" state="late" }%
%<nop>ACTIONSEARCH{ who="TWikiGuest" state="open" within="7" }%
%<nop>ACTIONSEARCH{ web=".*" who="Genghis.Khan@mongol.empire.org" state="open" within="7" }%
</pre>

---++++ Searching arbitrary attributes
You can of course search for values of arbitrary attributes (see #ArbitraryAttributes above). For example:
<pre>
%<nop>ACTIONSEARCH{ legion="7th" state="closed" }%
</pre>
The search expression for arbitrary attributes is always a perl regular expression, so you can search for the actions of all the legions:
<pre>
%<nop>ACTIONSEARCH{ legion="[0-9]+th" state="closed" }%
</pre>

#QueryByExample
---++++ Query-by-example action search

<form name="searchaction" action="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%#QueryByExample">
|  Who: | <input type="text" name="qwho" value="%URLPARAM{"qwho"}%" size="20" /> |
|  Notify: | <input type="text" name="qnotify" value="%URLPARAM{"qnotify"}%" size="20" /> |
|  State: | <select name="qstate"> <option>%URLPARAM{"qstate"}%</option> <option>open</option> <option>late</option> <option>closed</option> <option></option> </select> |
|  Within: | <input type="text" name="qwithin" value="%URLPARAM{"qwithin"}%" size="3" /> days |
|  Web: | <input type="text" name="qweb" value="%URLPARAM{"qweb"}%" size="20" /> |
|  Topic: | <input type="text" name="qtopic" value="%URLPARAM{"qtopic"}%" size="20" /> |
| | <input type="submit" value="Go" /> |
</form>
%ACTIONSEARCH{ who="%URLPARAM{"qwho"}%" notify="%URLPARAM{"qnotify"}%" state="%URLPARAM{"qstate"}%" within="%URLPARAM{"qwithin"}%" web="%URLPARAM{"qweb"}%" topic="%URLPARAM{"qtopic"}%" }%

---+++ Formatting actions
#FormattingActions
The =header= and =format= parameters support formatting of the action table using a similar syntax to that described in %TWIKIWEB%.FormattedSearch.

| *Name:* | *Expands To:* |
| =$who= | Who is responsible for the action |
| =$due= | When the action is due |
| =$state= | Current state of the action (see also note below) |
| =$notify= | Who to notify when the action state changes |
| =$closed= | When the action was closed, and who closed it |
| =$creator= | Who created the action |
| =$created= | When the action was created |
| =$edit= | A link to the action editor for this action |
| =$uid= | Unique identifier for the action |
| =$web= | Name of the web containing the action |
| =$topic= | Topic name containing the action |
| =$text= | Formatted action text |
| =$n= or =$n()= | New line |
| =$nop= or =$nop()= | Is a "no operation". This variable gets removed; useful for nested search |
| =$quot= | Double quote (="=). Alternatively write =\"= to escape it |
| =$percnt= | Percent sign (=%=) |
| =$dollar= | Dollar sign (=$=) |

__Note:__ the =state= field is automatically formatted with closure information if the action is closed e.g. "closed 1-Mar-2003 by Mad<nop>March<nop>Hare". The default format can be defined in this topic; see #Settings, below.

A default format for actions and action search results can be defined in this topic or the Web<nop>Preferences topic of the current web. See #Settings for more details.

Arbitrary attributes (see #ArbitraryAttributes above) can be inserted using the same syntax; for example,
<pre>
%<nop>ACTIONSEARCH{ legion="[0-9]+th" state="closed" format="|$cohort|$maniple|$text|"}%
</pre>

---+++ Assigning actions to groups

To assign an action to a group you must set up a pseudo-user that represents the group. Create a new topic in the '%MAINWEB%' web with the name of the group as the name of the page, and then add lines using the format<br />
	_three spaces_ * Email:<br />
or<br />
	_three spaces_ * E-mail:<br />
one per member of the group. For example, you might have the topic Main.<nop>EmpireBuilders with contents:
<pre>
	* Email: Atilla@huns.com
	* E-mail: Genghis.Khan@mongol.empire.org
</pre>
You can then assign actions using =who="EmpireBuilders"=. Note that this technique allows you to assign actions to groups of people who are *not* registered with your TWiki (and may not wish to be).

Note that you can also use pseudo-users in =notify=.

---+++ Notification

%TOPIC% comes with a notifier script, like the =mailnotify= script used for WebNotify (see TWiki.MonitoringSiteActivity for more information on setting up mailnotify). This script allows you to
	* examine all the actions in all webs (except those specified NOSEARCHALL) and notify owners of the state of actions,
	* find actions that have changed state and notify people who have registered an interest in that action.

The frequency with which actions are notified depends on how you set up your cron (or equivalent) jobs on the server.

The =actionnotify= script interprets its parameters as a search expression of the same type as that used in %<nop>ACTIONSEARCH%. All actions which match that expression will be notified to their owners. For example, you could set up the cron jobs as follows:
<pre>
0 * * * * /home/twiki/bin/actionnotify "state=\"late\""
0 8,16 * * * /home/twiki/bin/actionnotify "state=\"open\" within=\"3\""
0 0 * * * /home/twiki/bin/actionnotify "state=\"open\" within=\"7\"
0 0 * * 1 /home/twiki/bin/actionnotify "state=\"open\" within=\"30\"
</pre>
(If you don't know cron, the first 5 fields are minute, hour, day of month, month and day of week. * means 'every'). This crontab will notify actions according to the schedule:
	1 Actions that are late will be notified every hour, on the hour
	2 Actions that are still open within three days of their due date will be notified twice a day, at 8am and 4pm
	3 Actions that are still open within seven days of their due date will be notified once a day, at midnight.
	4 Actions that are still open within thirty days of their due date will be notified once a week, at midnight on monday.
A rather aggressive schedule!

__Note:__ At Wind River they notify folks three times a week on Mon, Wed and Fri for open action items due within 8 days. <br /><font size="-2">Crontab entry for geeks: =0 0 * * 1,3,5 (cd /twiki1/httpd/twiki-bin; ./actionnotify state=open within=8 'web=<nop>[CEIMPSW].*' &gt; /twiki1/httpd/htdocs/pub/actionnotify.txt 2&gt;&amp;1)= </font>

The wiki name of the user to be notified is translated to a mail address according to the following rules:
	* If they are listed in WebNotify *in any web*, the mail address given there is used.
	* If this fails and they have a personal page, and that personal page contains a line or lines matching<br />
	_three spaces_ * Email: _email address_ <br />
	or<br />
	_three spaces_ * E-mail: _email address_ <br />
	then the notification is sent to *all* those e-mail addresses. This is how you assign actions to groups.
	* If this fails and the 'who' name is a valid e-mail address, for example person@domain.co.uk, then that name is used.

The =actionnotify= script is also used to notify users who have registered an interest in being notified when an action changes. This function of the script is activated when you use the special =changedsince= parameter.

__Note:__ When =changedsince= is active the other functions of the script, as described above, are disabled.

=changedsince= is used to specify the time period within which changed actions are interesting. Any action which has changed in the given period will be notified to all users who have registered an interest using =notify=. The =changedsince= value is a relative date string, which uses the following formats 
	* yesterday
	* last _dow_ (e.g. "last monday")
	* last week
	* now - _count_ _units_ (e.g. "now - 3 days")
	* - _count_ _units_
	* _count_ _units_ ago
where _units_ may be minutes, days, hours, weeks, months or even years. _count_ is just an integer. _dow_ is the name of a day of the week.

Obviously you have to be careful to synchronise your =changedsince= expression with the activation of your cron job. The ideal is to specify the same delta as the gap between cron activations. For example,
<pre>
0 0 * * * /home/twiki/bin/actionnotify "web=\"News\" changedsince=\"yesterday\""
</pre>
will notify registered users of action changes that occurred in the last 24 hours.

Not all action changes get notified; only changes to the action state, or changes to the text of the action (usually additions) get notified. For example, if the person responsible for the action is changed, or its due date, then no notification is generated.

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Settings
#Settings
	* One line description, shown in the TextFormattingRules topic
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Adds support for action tags in topics, and automatic notification of action statii
	* The format of an action output. The following fields can be output: web, topic, text, who, due, notify, uid, creator, state, edit. FORMAT defines the contents of the columns, HEADER defines the column headings. These settings can be overridden in the Web<nop>Preferences topic of the current web (by defining ACTIONTRACKERPLUGIN_HEADER and ACTIONTRACKERPLUGIN_FORMAT) or in an ACTIONSEARCH command.
		* Set TABLEHEADER = | Assigned to | Due date | Description | State ||
		* Set TABLEFORMAT = | $who | $due | $text | $state | $edit |
		* Set TEXTFORMAT = Action for $who, due $due, $state$n$text
	* If set to 1 will edit an action in a separate browser window (requires <nop>JavaScript)
		* Set USENEWWINDOW = 1
	* Set the width of the action text edit box
		* Set EDITBOXWIDTH = 79
	* Set the height of the action text edit box
		* Set EDITBOXHEIGHT = 5
	* If set to 1, action edits will offer a 'Save Changes' instead of the usual 'Preview Changes' button. If this is set along with the USENEWWINDOW parameter, the subwindow will close on save.
		* Set NOPREVIEW = 1
	* The command to use to recover revision info. This is only required if you want to use actionnotify with the 'changedsince' parameter, and must be the command used to find out the revision number of a topic (in standard RCS format) at a given date. The response is searched to find the string "revision x.y" where x.y was the revision at the given date.
		* Set LOGCMD = /usr/bin/rlog -d'%DATE%' %FILENAME%
	* The fields to scan to detect changes for actionnotify. Changes in other fields are ignored.
		* Set NOTIFYCHANGES = $due,$state,$text

---++ %RED%Known Issues%ENDCOLOR%

---+++ Corruption of action items with Mozilla browser
Action lines are joined together if edited by a Mozilla browser, resulting in an odd display.
	* Work-around: Edit the topic ("Edit" at the bottom of the page, not the "edit" of the ActionTrackerPlugin) and add a new line to the =%<nop>ACTION{...}%=. Basically, each =%<nop>ACTION{...}%= needs to be on its own line. 

---+++ Behaviour of egrep

The output of the =$egrepCmd= in TWiki.cfg (with no switches) must be of the form:
	<pre>
	filename.txt: ...matched text...
	</pre>
	While this is true for all UNIX grep implementations, it may be a potential issue for other operating systems.
