---+ SeeSkinToo

...is an attempt at creating a more advanced and polished SeeSkin. It will probably replace SeeSkin entirely at some point.

---++ Quick Install

	1. unpack the archive from twiki-root.
	2. if you don't already have it, put the =savemulti= script from SeeSkin or KoalaSkin into $twikiroot/bin/
	3. Edit TWiki.TWikiPreferences, or WebPreferences, or your <nop>UserName topic and add the following:
<verbatim>
---++ Plugins.SeeSkinToo preferences.

		* Set SKIN = seetoo
		* Set SEESOURCE = /twiki/pub/Plugins/SeeSkinToo
		* Set STYLESHEETS = <link rel="stylesheet" href='%SEESOURCE%/menu-top.css' type="text/css" media="screen,projection" /> <link rel="stylesheet" href='%SEESOURCE%/ss-%WEB%.css' type="text/css" media="screen,projection" />
		* Set INLINESTYLE = 
</verbatim>

The css files are fairly well commented. ==menu-top== and ==menu-left== control the page layout and positioning. The ==ss-%<nop>WEB%.css== are for colour and light typography (e.g. weight, font-family). As with SeeSkin INLINESTYLE can be used to override/redefine any of the stylesheet rules (do so with a light hand however).
 
As always, feedback is welcome.

---++ Help Wanted
_things I don't know how to do or could use some help with_

	* browser testing. I test with Mozilla 1.3 and IE5.5/Win. I don't know how well, or how badly, this skin performs for other browsers.

	* more colour themes (done: blue, gray, yellow, light orange)

	* anchor links classed by destination: within this page, local to site, external site, and opens new window. This is to allow different styles based on the link destination, for example local to page is <a href="#content" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #00a;" title="jump to somewhere else on this page">dashed-underline</a>, local to site is a <a href="WebHome">normal link</a>, an external site is a <strong><a href="#">strong link</a></strong>, while a new browser window is a <a href="#" style="border: 1px dotted gray; padding: 1px;" title="opens new browser window">dotted border</a>.
		* probably requires modifying twiki code, so this would be a desired patch rather than SeeSkin code (I want to this to remain a skin and not a plugin).
		* found some javascript which does this; see http://squarefree.com/ and look for the *ext/int* bookmarklet.


	* a method of making =textarea= height fit the browser window.

	* to be able to render SpacedOutWikiWords (I am aware of the plugin which does this, however it only affects the content area)

I've decided I'm not worried about staying away from javascript _as long as it has little impact those surfing without it_. For example
	* I want the left and right columns to be subdued and in the background (e.g. muted colours) until they are hovered over, or get keyboard focus, a they should come into focus (e.g. bright strong colours). I've tried using the css =:hover= element but it just doesn't do the trick.

---++ Known Problems
	* IE/Win5.5 doesn't honour =pre {overflow:auto}= , so if a wide =pre= block appears in the first 15 lines or so it overwrites the navigation links on the right hand side. 
	* IE5.5/Win has this annoying habit of making tables wider than the containing =div=  ,a fix or workaround would be nice.


---++ Changelog

2003-Mar-10
	* Numerous stylesheet refinements.
		* fixed bug where the "More..." menu item used a different font size and background extended slightly beyond the menu panel.
		* started developing =menu-bottom.css=  (only works in browsers which support =position: fixed= )
	* Added templates: search, edit, oopsmore, attach, preview. 
		* Introduced a bug: menu-left.css only works for the view template, in others the empty menu pane covers up page contents.
	* fixed bug in cvs where the SeeSkin and SeeSkinToo directories kept overwriting each other (note: if you copy a directory and contents to use as a template make sure to _delete the CVS subdirectory_ )

2003-Feb-24
	* =twiki.seetoo.tmpl= : search link was hardcoded to TWiki web.
