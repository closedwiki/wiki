---+!! SeeSkin

A TWiki skin relying completely on CSS for layout and presentation.

*Development status:* not ready for production, needs some fine tuning, but certainly ready for everyday use. It is the default skin at my work. It is known to display mostly correctly in Mozilla 1.x, Netscape 6.x, Internet Explorer 5.5+. Other browsers should be presented with a functional, though not necessarily pretty, page.

Feedback goes to TWiki:/Plugins/SeeSkinDev

---++ Installation

If your directory structure is the same as the TWiki default (as of the August 2002 beta) just unpack the archive from the top of your twiki directory. Otherwise:

	* put =*see*.tmpl= in =templates/=
	* put =savemulti= in =bin/= _(only if you don't have TWiki:Plugins/KoalaSkin)_
	* =SeeSkin.txt= in  =data/Plugins/=
	* the stylesheets (*.css) in =pub/Plugins/SeeSkin/=

	* 'Set SKIN = see' in the appropriate place (TWiki.TWikiPreferences, TWiki.WebPreferences, or your user page)

*New variables* to set in the same places: _(see heading of same name down in the page for details)_
<verbatim>
		* Set SKIN = see
		* Set SEESOURCE = %PUBURLPATH%/Plugins/SeeSkin
		* Set STYLESHEETS = <link rel="stylesheet" href='%SEESOURCE%/ss-layout.css' type="text/css" media="all"  /> <link rel="stylesheet" href='%SEESOURCE%/ss-colour.css' type="text/css" media="all"  /> <link rel="alternate stylesheet" href='%SEESOURCE%/show-struct.css' type="text/css" media="screen" title="Show Structure" /> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="print" href='%SEESOURCE%/print.css'>
		* Set INLINESTYLE = body {background-color: %WEBBGCOLOR%; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;}
</verbatim>

and that's it, you are done.

------------------------------------------------------------
---+++ Optional

	* to have the background colours for each web show up in the WIKIWEBLIST (top right corner) add ==style='background:%<nop>VAR{"WEBBGCOLOR" web="[web-name]"}%'== to each list item within the anchor tag in TWiki.TWikiPreferences.
	* to use TWiki:Codev/AccessKeys add something like ==title="safe place to learn TWiki [Alt-7]" accesskey="7"== to each anchor tag

This is a portion of my WIKIWEBLIST in a semi-legible format. It must be all in a single unwrapped line when in TWiki.TWikiPreferences.
<blockquote>
<verbatim>
<a href="="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%TWIKIWEB%" 
	title="System documentation & site config [Alt-9]" 
	accesskey="9" style='background:%VAR{"WEBBGCOLOR" web="%TWIKIWEB%"}%'>
	%TWIKIWEB% 
</a>
%SEP% 
<a href="="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%MAINWEB%" 
	title="Users, Groups & Offices [Alt-8]" 
	accesskey="8" 
	style='background:%VAR{"WEBBGCOLOR" web="%MAINWEB%"}%'> 
	%MAINWEB% 
</a> 
%SEP% 
<a href="="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/Sandbox" 
	title="safe place to learn TWiki [Alt-7]" 
	accesskey="7" 
	style='background:%VAR{"WEBBGCOLOR" 
	web="Sandbox"}%'> 
	Sandbox
</a> 
</verbatim>
</blockquote>

	* If you have done TWiki:Codev/RenameWebToZone or something else edit =see.tmpl= and change =%TMPL:DEF{"weblabel"}%=

---+++ Customizing

*Quick Start:* edit a css file and then attach it to this topic; update STYLESHEETS variable.

*The Details:* 

I have tried to design this so that most parts of the look and feel can be changed without having to edit the templates. No doubt the passage of time will put this to the test.  

Layout - position of the menu, navigation links, etc. - is handled by ==ss-layout.css== .

Colours are controlled by ==ss-colour.css== ,excepting the page background colour which is handled the TWiki way by WEBBGCOLOR in TWiki.WebPreferences. This is also the recommended place to change things like the default font-family.

It is recommended you copy these files and edit them under another name so that future upgrades don't clobber your hard work.

See [[Codev.CssResources]] for a list of websites and tools to help with CSS authoring.

-------------------------------------------------
---++ New Variables

SeeSkin introduces some new variables, defined in the usual places (TWiki.WebPreferences, etc.), which control which stylsheets are loaded by default and local overrides. 

	* Where the stylesheets are located:
<verbatim>
		* Set SEESOURCE = %PUBURLPATH%/Plugins/SeeSkin
</verbatim>

	* List of style sheets to load, using standard HTML format. :
<verbatim>
		* Set STYLESHEETS = <link rel="stylesheet" href='%SEESOURCE%/ss-layout.css' type="text/css" media="all"  /> <link rel="stylesheet" href='%SEESOURCE%/ss-colour.css' type="text/css" media="all"  /> <link rel="alternate stylesheet" href='%SEESOURCE%/show-struct.css' type="text/css" media="all" title="show document structure" /> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="print" href='/twiki/pub/Plugins/SeeSkin/print.css'>
</verbatim>
		* Each =link= is appended the contents of the previous =link= stylesheet. This allows a sitewide definitions which can be changed and expanded in local contexts (per web, user, or even topic). 
		* =alternate link= stylesheets are loaded but not activated, relying on the browsers alternate style display mechanism. (Mozilla: _View > Use Style_ ,IE: http://tantek.com/favelets/)
		* More info on how to use =link= : http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/style-html.html
		* Note it is important to have the =media= attribute defined in the first =link= in order to hide it from Netscape 4; see http://css-discuss.incutio.com/?page=ImportHack

	* INLINESTYLE is embedded in each page and loaded last, appending and/or overriding any previous styling. Because the styles are inline to each web page it is best to keep it as short as possible.
<verbatim>
		* Set INLINESTYLE = body {background: %WEBBGCOLOR%; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: small;}
</verbatim>


---++ To Do

	* IE5.5/Win displays table wider than content div in: attach.tmpl, TWiki.WebSearch, ... basically anywhere the content holds a table with =width="100%"=
	* Test in more browsers, make fixes as necessary (so far: Mozilla 1.x, IE5.5/Win, IE6/Win, Netscape 4, lynx)

---++ Help Wanted

	* The current method of defining WIKIWEBLIST and STYLESHEETS is very ugly and cumbersome. Does anybody know of a cleaner method where you don't have enter all the html code?
	* Browser testing. Please put your results in SeeSkinDev.
	* Some alternate stylesheets. I'm not a very good graphic designer. Although I think I have done a passable job of improving on the default twiki look a lot more could be done.
