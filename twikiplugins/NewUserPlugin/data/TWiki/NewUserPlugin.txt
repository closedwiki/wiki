---+!! NewUserPlugin
%TOC%

This plugin is of use in those cases where TWiki users are registered and authenticated externally, 
for example using LDAP.
So users are not registered to TWiki using its own registration workflow and therefore don't
have a user topic in the %USERSWEB% web.
This plugin fills that gap and creates a user's topic if it does not yet exist.

---++ Settings
<!--
    * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Create a user topic if it does not exist yet
-->
You can customize the template that is used to create a new user topic
by setting the =NEWUSERTEMPLATE= preference variable (e.g. in %USERSWEB%.TWikiPreferences):
   
   * Set NEWUSERTEMPLATE = %SYSTEMWEB%.NewLdapUserTemplate

If not set, it defaults to <nop>NewUserTemplate. This plugin comes with an example template,
NewLdapUserTemplate, to illustrate how to extract user data from an LDAP directory and integrate
the information into the user's topic dynamically. You will need to install the
TWiki:Plugins/LdapNgPlugin and the TWiki:Plugins/GluePlugin to make use of it.
