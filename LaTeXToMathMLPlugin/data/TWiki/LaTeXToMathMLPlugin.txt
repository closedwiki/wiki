%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

---++ Overview

This plugin translates embedded <nop>LaTeX-like equations into in-line <nop>MathML. It requires a <nop>MathML enabled browser, such as Mozilla.

See TWiki:Codev.MathMarkup for some Javascript-only client-side alternatives.

---++ Syntax Rules

The syntax rules for embedding equations are identical to those of the TWiki:Plugins.MathModePlugin and are based on <nop>LaTeX's own markup for equations.  The equations themselves are expressed in a language very, very similar to <nop>LaTeX called [[http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MML.html][itex2MML]]. (Apparently the major differences are in the way equation arrays are handled.)

To put an equation in-line with your text, enclose it with percent signs and
the dollar sign, 
<pre>
   %$ put your math here $%
</pre>
for example:
<pre>
   %$  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = U(x) $%
</pre>
where the opening and closing delimiter must be on the same line.

For equations set on their own line, use the 
<pre>
   %\[ put your math here \]%
</pre>
notation, for example:
<pre>
   %\[  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = U(x) \]%
</pre>
and the font will be slightly larger.

For equations written over several lines in the original TWiki document you use the =%<nop>MATHMODE{ "a=b" }%= delimiter.  The value in quotes is type set, whether or not it is on a single line.  However, unlike the other delimiters, this is also typeset in &lt;pre&gt; environments.

---++ Examples

%$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n} $% is divergent, but %$ \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i} - \ln n $% exists.

This is an %$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = U(x)$% inline equation.

This equation %\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \pi \int_a^b F(x) dx\]% should be typset on its own line.

This equation %MATHMODE{"
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 
          \omega \int_a^b F(x) dx
"}%
is broken over several lines of source text.

---++ Resources for <nop>MathML

   * [[http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/][Mozilla's <nop>MathML Project]]
      contains information on how to get started with <nop>MathML in Mozilla.
      A default installation from a major Linux distribution ought to be
      complete enough to use this plug-in.  It is available for free.
      _See notes below._
   * The [[http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MML.html][itex2MML]]
      program is a [[http://www.gnu.org/directory/flex.html][FLEX/LEX]]
      parser which this plug-in uses to do the actual translation of the
      <nop>LaTeX equations into <nop>MathML.
   * Use the [[http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/demo/texvsmml.xhtml][MathML Torture Test]] to see if your browser supports !MathML.
   * At the [[http://www.w3.org/Math/][W3C Math Home Page]] you can find the DTD for
     <nop>MathML along with authoring information.  You can even read the 1993 proposal
     neglected for so many years.  Advocates of the commercialization of the web:
     please note the delay and feel __shame__.
   * If your organisation does not allow Mozilla then there is a plug-in available
     at [[http://www.dessci.com/en/products/webeq/webeq.asp][Design Science]] which
     may do the trick. _(I haven't tried this one.)_

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Global Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>LATEXTOMATHMLPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

   * One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Display <nop>LaTeX-like equations in-line using <nop>MathML

   * Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
      * Set DEBUG = 0

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions

__Note:__ You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this plugin (although your browser must be capable of displaying <nop>MathML). The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the plugin on the TWiki server.

   * Install the program
     [[http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MML.html][itex2MML]] on your
     system.  The location must be somewhere that your web server can access.

   * If you have it installed, disable the TWiki:Plugins/MathModePlugin by
    adding it to the =DISABLEDPLUGINS= line of your [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]]
    page.  For example:%BR%
      * Set DISABLEDPLUGINS = <nop>MathModePlugin 

   * Alter the main =twiki.pattern.tmpl= template in the TWiki installation, in the
      =./templates= directory, or in the sub-directory of any Web that will
      use this plugin.  The line %BR%
      =&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;= %BR%
      must be changed to support the <nop>MathML DTD.  Replace it with:%BR%
      =&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus !MathML 2.0//EN"= %BR%
      =&lt;literal&gt;    "http://www.w3.org/Math/DTD/mathml2/xhtml-math11-f.dtd" [= %BR%
      =<nop>    &lt;!ENTITY mathml "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;= %BR%
      =]&gt;&lt;/literal&gt;= %BR%

<!--   * Alter the =lib/TWiki.pm= file so that the content type is emitted not
      as =text/html= but rather =application/xhtml+xml= .  *This is a rather*
      __dire__ *change.*  If you have done anything on your pages that is not
      legal XHTML then your browser may complain mightily.
      <p></p> The change is in =sub writeHeader= about line 505, where
      the statement 
      <pre> writeHeaderFull( $query, 'basic', 'text/html', 0);</pre>
      needs to become 
      <pre> writeHeaderFull( $query, 'basic', 'application/xhtml+xml', 0);</pre>
-->

   * Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below)

   * Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:
     <p></p>
     | *File:* | *Description:* |
     | ==data/TWiki/%TOPIC%.txt== | Plugin topic |
     | ==pub/TWiki/%TOPIC%/xhtml-math11-f.dtd== | XML DTD for XHTML 1.1 and <nop>MathML |
     | ==lib/TWiki/Plugins/%TOPIC%.pm== | Plugin Perl module |

   * Visit =configure= in your TWiki installation, and enable the plugin in the {Plugins} section.

   * If your system does not have =itex2MML= on the default path, edit
     the line of =%TOPIC%.pm= that reads:
    <pre> my $itex2MML = 'itex2MML'; </pre> 
    to contain the whole path to the executable.  For example:
    <pre> my $itex2MML = '/usr/local/bin/itex2MML';</pre>

   * Test if the installation was successful: the examples above should be
      rendered as equations, not text.

---+++ Notes

   1. This plug-in conflicts with the TWiki:Plugins.MathModePlugin 
      which will need to be disabled.  If you re-enable it later, you may need
      to re-edit pages to update any graphics of math that it would have
      otherwise generated.  You may wish to clean-up the graphics left by
      TWiki:Plugins.MathModePlugin in the =pub/= directories.
   %BR%
   1. Note that documents must be served to Mozilla as =application/xhtml+xml= for the
     <nop>MathML portion to be rendered correctly.  This can pose some challenges for
     existing TWiki installations with less than tidy XHTML.
   %BR%
   1. Mozilla on Linux has a problem with Xft, the <nop>FreeType renderer for fonts.
     This in turn causes problems with =xfs=, the X11 font server that uses Xft.
     For Mozilla versions before 1.4 (assuming this gets fixed in 1.4) you have to
     set the environment variable <pre>  setenv GDK_USE_XFT 0 </pre> to enable
     the correct rendering of the <nop>TeX Computer Modern fonts.  You may also need to
     install those fonts, as noted on the
     [[http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/fonts][<nop>MathML project fonts page.]]
