Because you may not view all the users of this wiki as trustworthy and skilled as others you can make the ratings dependent on your interactions with them. You can set this option on your user page %WIKIUSERNAME% by writing the following setting to your personal preferences.
<verbatim>
   * Set REPUTATIONPLUGIN_ABSOLUTE = relative
</verbatim>
After this setting has been selected all the topic ratings which have not been especially marked as absolute values will be relative.
