---++ Reputation and trust

Because you may not view all the users of this wiki as trustworthy or skilled as others you can make the ratings dependent on your interactions with them. You can set this option on your user page %WIKIUSERNAME% by writing the following setting to your personal preferences.
<verbatim>
   * Set REPUTATIONPLUGIN_ABSOLUTE = relative
</verbatim>
After this setting has been enabled all the topic ratings which have not been especially marked to use absolute values will be relative. The values will be relative to the reputation of the other users. It is possible to change and check the value of trust you have to other users on this wiki
[[TWiki.ReputationPluginChangeValues][on this page.]]<br /><br />
