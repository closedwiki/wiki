%TOC%

Supports editing a single row in a table at a time, in-place in the table.
Multiple tables in a topic are supported, but only once table at a time
can be edited.

Works like the !EditTablePlugin (it uses exactly the same =%EDITTABLE= tags)
except that it only opens one row at a time. Closed rows are shown with
an edit %ICON{edittopic}% button.

This solves the problem with the long page rendering times required to show all
the HTML for a full table edit on big tables.

At this time most features of !EditTablePlugin are supported. Known exceptions
are:
   * the =helptopic= and =editbutton= switches, which are ignored,
   * the =EDITCELL= feature, which is not supported,
   * access controls, which are only checked on topic save.

The plugin doesn't use !JavaScript (except for the calendar) so it should
work with all browsers.

See also: !EditTablePlugin, !EditTableRowPlugin.

---++ Usage

See EditTablePlugin for information on the =%EDITTABLE= tag and its
parameters. The same tag syntax is used for this plugin. When a table row is
edited, then four buttons may be shown in the row depending on the settings
of =changerows= and =quietsave=.
   * %ICON{save}% saves the changes in the current row
   * %ICON{quiet}% saves without notification
   * %ICON{plus}% adds a new row after the current row (taking for its contents whatever you entered into the current row). 
   * %ICON{minus}% deletes that row.

If both !EditRowPlugin and !EditTablePlugin are required, then you have to put !EditRowPlugin into ={PluginsOrder}= in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{configure}%][configure]]) before !EditTablePlugin.

The assumption is that most of the time you will want to use EditTablePlugin, and will only enable this plugin in topics where there are large tables that it can't cope with. So this plugin has to be enabled specifically by setting
   * Set ENABLE_TABLE_ROW_EDIT = on
in a topic or !WebPreferences. It is enabled in this topic, so if it is working then the following
examples will be editable.
