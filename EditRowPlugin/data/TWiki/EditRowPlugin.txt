%TOC%

A clone of !EditTablePlugin that supports editing a single row in a table
at a time, in-place in the table.
Multiple tables in a topic are supported, but only one table at a time
can be open for editing.

Works like the !EditTablePlugin (it uses exactly the same =%EDITTABLE= tags) and
you can use it to edit the entire table. The main purpose, though, is to support
editing one row at a time. Closed rows are shown with
an edit %ICON{edittopic}% button.

So why should you use this plugin instead of the !EditTablePlugin?
   1 The plugin knows if you can modify the topic or
     not, and only offers the editing controls if you can modify the table.
   1 You can edit one row at a time, instead of havng to edit the entire
     table. This solves the problem with the long page rendering times
     required to show all the HTML for a full table edit on big tables.
   1 The plugin doesn't use !JavaScript (except for the calendar) and
     doesn't do anything clever with CSS, so it should work with all browsers.
   1 The plugin is coded using a clean object-oriented architecture, which
     means it is easily extensible.

At this time most features of !EditTablePlugin are supported. Known exceptions
are:
   * the =helptopic= and =editbutton= switches, which are ignored,
   * the =EDITCELL= feature, which is not supported,
   * The "Initial values" feature, which is incompatible with the way this plugin adds new rows.

---++ Usage

See EditTablePlugin for information on the =%EDITTABLE= tag and its
parameters. The same tag syntax is used for this plugin.

Table rows are shown with an edit button %ICON{edittopic}% in the first column,
and a table edit button <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/edittable.gif" /> after the
table. When the table is
edited, then a number of buttons may be shown depending on the
settings of =changerows= and =quietsave=.
   * %ICON{save}% saves the changes
   * <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/quiet.gif" /> saves without notification
   * %ICON{plus}% adds a new row after the current row, taking for its contents whatever you entered into the current row
   * %ICON{minus}% deletes the row
   * %ICON{stop}% switches off the edit

If the plugin is installed and working *and you can modify this topic* then
the following examples will be editable.
---+++ Example 1
%EDITTABLE{ format="| row, -1 | text, 20, init | select, 1, one, two, three, four | radio, 3,:-),:-I,:-( | label, 20 |" changerows="on" quietsave="on" }%
