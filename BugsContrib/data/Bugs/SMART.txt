SMART means Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timeframed. It is usaually applied to actions from meetings, but applies almost as well to bug reports.

All Items should be SMART. that means the reports must
   1 *Specific*: Be clear enough that anyone can take a stab at solving the problem, and have individual names associated with the report and with the fixing process
   1 *Measureable*: Have a clear statement of what is required to be able to close them (a testcase is always best!)
   1 *Achievable*: Any time constraints must be thought about so that the fixers have a chance.
   1 *Realistic*: Obvious, really
   1 *Timeframed*: as soon as you know when a problem is going to be fixed, reflect it in the report.
