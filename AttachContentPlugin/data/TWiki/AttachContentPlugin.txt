---+!! <nop>%TOPIC%

This plugin puts any text between a =%<nop>STARTATTACH{"filename"}%= and =%<nop>ENDATTACH%= into an attachment with the given filename.

The current version only refreshes the attachment when the topic is saved. Obviously this means that the attachment can get out of synch if, for example, it explicitly or implicitly refers to other topics.

This plugin is written specifically to be able to put css into topic(s) and still be able to have efficient stylesheets: i.e., without the overhead of TWiki processing. The feature can be used for many other things where you want TWiki to generate a plain text file a smart way.

%TOC%

------

---++ Syntax Rules

Put in a =%<nop>STARTATTACH{"filename"}%= before the content you want in the attached textfile, and =%<nop>ENDATTACH%= after it, and the contents in between will be attached to the topic, for easy reference by other pages.

---++ Examples

This example sets backgroup color using a variable. The variable is expanded when the content is rendered, and resulting text is saved to "mycolors.css".

This example will change the background to grey once the file is saved, if you are using TWiki.PatternSkin - refreshing your browser cache between tries might be necessarry, typically this is done by pressing CTRL-F5.

Set color:
   * Set BG = eeeeee

<pre>
%STARTATTACH{"mycolors.css"}%
#patternTopBar {
	background-color:#%BG%;
	border-color:#ccc;
}
#patternOuter {
	background-color:#%BG%;
	border-color:#ccc;
}
#patternBottomBar {
	background-color:#%BG%;
	border-color:#ccc;
}
html body {
	background-color:#%BG%;
}
%ENDATTACH%
</pre>

   * Set USERCOLORSURL = %ATTACHURL%/mycolors.css

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>CACHECONTENTPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

   * One line description, is shown in the %TWIKIWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Caches portions of a topic in attachments to that topic

   * Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
      * Set DEBUG = 0

   * Keep paragraph  &lt;p /&gt; tags, &lt;nop&gt; tags, and square bracket type links.
      * Set KEEPPARS = 0
