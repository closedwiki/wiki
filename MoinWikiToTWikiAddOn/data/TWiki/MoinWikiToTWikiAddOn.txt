---+ !MoinWikiToTWikiAddOn Add-On

This is a command line tool to import !MoinWiki pages and !MoinWiki images/attachments into TWiki. It attempts to convert !MoinWiki syntax into equivalent TWiki syntax. It also attempts to convert !MoinWiki hierarchies into TWiki hierarchies. So a !MoinWiki page like:
   * Grandparent/Parent/OurPage
will be converted into TWiki page *OurPage* with a parent of *Parent*. The only exception is if there are !MoinWiki pages like:
   * Grandparent/Parent1/OurData
   * Grandparent/Parent2/OurData
where the actual !MoinWiki pages have identical names ( *OurPage*). In this case the TWiki pages created would be *Parent1OurData* and *Parent2OurData* (so the parent name is prepended to the front of the TWiki page name).

Other features provides:
   1 This script creates a new !MoinWiki page called !CurrentWikiIndex which contains links to all !MoinWiki pages converted.
   1 This script creates a new TWiki page called !ConvertIndexWiki which contains links to all new TWiki pages. This allows you to have side-by-side browsers showing !MoinWiki pages and TWiki pages making it easy to see any differences in formating
   1 This script creates an Apache mapping file that can be used by an Apache configuration file allowing Apache to easily map between !MoinWiki URLs and TWiki URLs.

---++ Add-On Installation Instructions

__Note:__ You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this add-on. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the add-on on the server where TWiki is running.

   * Download the ZIP file from the Add-on Home (see below)
   * Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:
| *File:* | *Description:* |
| ==data/TWiki/MoinWikiToTWikiAddOn.txt== |  Add-on topic |
| ==tools/moin2twiki.pl== |  convert script |
   * Edit file *tools/moin2twiki.pl* updating the following three (3) variables: 
      1 $TWikiHome - Change to point to the top level of your TWiki installation
      1 $TWikiWeb - The TWiki web where you want the !MoinWiki pages copied into
      1 $moinPages - Change to point to where your !MoinWiki pages are located
   * Create a new TWiki web with the name specified in $TWikiWeb
   * Now just run *tools/moin2twiki.pl*
   * Optionally look at the created TWiki page $TWikiPage/CurrentWikiIndex and the page created in !MoinWiki !CurrentWikiIndex.

---++ How to run

After editing *tools/moin2twiki.pl* just run the script and you are done.

---++ Optional Apache configuration setup

If you desire to set Apache up such that the same !MoinWiki URLs work in the TWiki environment, the following Apache configuration can be used as a template to set this up.
<verbatim>
    RewriteMap moinToTwiki txt:/var/www/TWiki/moin2TWikiMapping.txt
    # If not /bin and not /pub then it doesn't appear to be a TWiki url so
    # it is probably an old Moin url so we map to the TWiki name.
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  !^/bin/.*
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  !^/pub/.*
    RewriteRule (.*) ${moinToTwiki:$1} [R]
</verbatim>

---++ Known Issues
If a !MoinWiki page has a line with multiple {{{ }}} constructs, this convert script does not handle this correctly.  The script is designed to only handle a single set of {{{ }}} per line.
