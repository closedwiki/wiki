This file documents the various automatic TWiki test suites.

   1. Unit Tests
   2. TestCases Tests

Unit Tests
==========

Unit tests are held in the subdirectory "unit", and are written using
CPAN:Test::Unit (*thus you'll need to have it installed*)

All TWiki unit tests are run from that directory with the command:

perl ../bin/TestRunner.pl TWikiSuite.pm

Attention: 

   * for the tests to be run, you need a valid LocalLib.cfg under
     /path/to/twiki/bin/ stating where your /path/to/twiki/lib directory is.

TestCases Tests
===============

TestCases tests use static test case topics held in the "TestCases" TWiki web.
See ../lib/TWiki/Plugins/TestFixturePlugin and ../data/TestCases/WebHome for
details on the support and process for these tests.
