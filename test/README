This file documents the various automatic TWiki test suites.

   1. Unit Tests
   2. TestCases Tests

Unit Tests
==========

Unit tests are held in the subdirectory "unit", and are written using CPAN:Test::Unit

All TWiki unit tests are run from that directory with the command:

perl ../bin/TestRunner.pl TWikiSuite.pm

TestCases Tests
===============

TestCases tests use static test case topics held in the "TestCases" TWiki web. See ../lib/TWiki/Plugins/TestFixturePlugin and ../data/TestCases/WebHome for details on the support and process for these tests.
