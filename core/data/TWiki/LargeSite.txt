---+!! Managing a Large Site

There is no limitation with the number of webs and users a TWiki site can have.
But there are several considerationgs needed to run a site having thousands of webs and tens of thousands of users.
This topic discusses those.

%TOC%

---++ User Management

The default user management scheme using !TWikiUserMappingContrib and TWiki::Users::HtPasswdUser is not suitable for tens of thousands of users because of the following factors.
   * !TWikiUserMappingContrib maintains the list of users on the !TWiki.TWikiUsersTemplate topic
   * TWiki::Users::HtPasswdUser stores user account data on a text file

You need to use e.g. !LdapContrib for TWiki::Users::LdapUserMapping and TWiki::LdapPasswdUser. Or you need to implement your own user mapping manager which is scalalbe.
If your environment provides intranet single sign-on and user directory (e.g. LDAP or !ActiveDirectory based), it's worth considering getting rid of user registration.

---++ Web Management

If you have thousands of webs, you face the following issues.
   * Getting the list of all webs takes a long time due to directory traversal.
   This happens e.g. when you move a topic.
   * The frequency of administrator help requests increases. Each web should be made as self-service as possible.
The first issue can be solved by MetadataRepository with <code>$TWiki::cfg{Mdrepo}{WebRecordRequired} = 1;</code>

The second issue can be solved by a combination of MetadataRepository#Web_admins and a custom user mapping manager referring to the web admin data.
The custom user mapping manager would have its own isAdmin(), which would return true for the web admin members.

---++ Eliminating Impractical Operations

If you have thousands of webs the following operations would take too long and cases time out:
   * "in all public webs" operations on the "More topic action"
      * Setting NOINALLPUBLICWEBS to "on" suppresses the "in all public webs" links.
   * !SiteChanges, the topic showing all recent changes across all webs, 
      * This topic should be deleted on a large site.

---++ Multiple Disks

A single disk may not be able to house all webs.
UsingMultipleDisks provides a way to use multiple disks.

---++ Locking down the %USERSWEB% web

If you have tens of thousand of users, to prevent unaccounted-for topics from accumulating in the %USERSWEB% web, you should lock it down.
Specifically, you should allow users to have only !FirstLast, !FirstLastLeftBar, and !FirstLastBookmarks.
This can be achieved by forbidding ordinary users CHANGE operation in the %USERWEB% web while customizing the isAdmin() method of the user mapping manager to make the user admin of their topics.

---++ User subwebs

If you have many users, a good number of them may want to have a web for their own use rather than for a team use.
In that case, providing them with their own subweb in the %USERSWEB% web might be a good idea.

You can see how to do it at UserSubwebs.

---++ User Masquerading

If you have thousands of webs, TWiki administrators (typically !TWikiAdminGroup members) have a big power.
Their administrative operations may need to be audited.

UserMasquerading provides a means to minimize the amount of time an administrator exercising the privilege and audit their activities.

In addition, UserMasquerading enables web owners to check access restriction settings on their own.
