---++ Preface

On a large TWiki installation having thousands of webs, things need to be as self-service as possible so that TWiki administrators' work is minimized.
For that, webs need to be as autonomous as possible.
To that end, it's handy to define a group of users who have full access to any topic on a particular web regardless of access control setting.

TWiki has a hook for that, which is to be used by a user mapping handler.
This topic describes how to tailor a user mapping handler to implement web admins.

---++ How to

isAdmin() method in a user mapping handler normaly takes only one argument, $cUID, excluding the object.
But the upstream code hands two additional arguments, the topic and web names currently being processed.

If you take topic and web into account when you determine the current user is an admin, you implement web admins.
