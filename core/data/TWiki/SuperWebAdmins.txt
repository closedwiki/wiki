---+!! Super Web Admins
%TOC%

---++ Preface

On a large TWiki site having thousands of webs, each web should be as self-service as possible so that TWiki administrators' work is minimized.
To that end, it would be handy to define a group of users who have full access to any topic on a particular web regardless of access control setting.

TWiki has a hook for that, which is to be used by the user mapping manager.
This topic describes how to tailor a user mapping manager to implement super web admins.

---++ Where the magic happens

The isAdmin() method in a user mapping manager normaly takes only one argument, $cUID. (e.g. !TWikiUserMapping's)
However, the upstream code hands two additional arguments, namely the topic and web names currently being processed.

By taking the topic and web into account when you determine the current user is an admin, you can implement "super web admins".

---++ How to specify web super admins

To have super admins for a web, you need to specify who are the web super admins.
A web's super admins need to be specified outside the web.
Otherwise, there is a possibility of the super admins lose access to the web by some change to the web.

MetadataRepository is one way to have metadata of a web outside the web.
In an example on MetadataRepository, a TWiki group specified by the =admin= field of the web's record is the super admins.

Another way is to put such a data on a topic or topics in the %SYSTEMWEB% web and make them editable only by TWiki Administrators.
