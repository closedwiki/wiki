=head1 NAME

CGI::Session::Driver::db_file - CGI::Session driver for BerkeleyDB using DB_File

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $s = new CGI::Session("driver:db_file", $sid);
    $s = new CGI::Session("driver:db_file", $sid, {FileName=>'/tmp/cgisessions.db'});

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<db_file> stores session data in BerkelyDB file using L<DB_File|DB_File> - Perl module. All sessions will be stored 
in a single file, specified in I<FileName> driver argument as in the above example. If I<FileName> isn't given, 
defaults to F</tmp/cgisess.db>, or its equivalent on a non-UNIX system.

If the directory hierarchy leading to the file does not exist, will be created for you.

This module takes a B<UMask> option which will be used if DB_File has to create the database file for you. By default
the umask is 0660.
