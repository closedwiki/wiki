---+!! User Subwebs
TWiki provides each user with their own topic having their information and configuration.
You may want to provide each user with a subweb Main/FirstLast having a topic having the user's information and configuration.

---++ Motivation
On a TWiki site having thousands of webs, web accountability is crucial.
Each web needs to have clearly defined owners so that TWiki admins can take actions such as deletion of unused webs.

On a TWiki site having thousands of users, the %USERSWEB% web needs to be locked down to prevent random topics from accumulating.
For that, a user should be able to have only !FirstLast, !FirstLastLeftBar, and !FirstLastBookmarks topics on the Main web.
This is inconvenient for users who want to have more topics for their personal use.

You may allow users to have a web for their personal use, but that would be messy on a large site - webs for personal use and team use co-existing at the same level.
If you have thousands of top level webs (non subweb) and thousands of users, then you may end up having much more top level webs than otherwise.

If users have Main/FirstLast subwebs instead of !Main.FirstLast topics, it would be a good compromise between accountability, convenience, and tidiness of the site.

---++ How it works
In general, if the TopLevel/SecondLevel subweb exists, !TopLevel.SecondLevel becomes a link to !TopLevel/SecondLevel.WebHome.
As such, if the user !FirstLast has the subweb %USERSWEB%/FirstLast, <nop>%USERSWEB%.FirstLast becomes the link to <nop>%USERSWEB%/FirstLast.WebHome.

If user subwebs are enabled, user configration is read first from the user's subweb.
If it fails, the user's topic is tried.
This way, you can have some users having their subwebs while the other users having user topics.

Please be noted that a user's topic and the subweb of the same user cannot coexist.
Because you cannot create the subweb TopLevel/SecondLevel if the topic !TopLevel.SecondLevel exists. (SubwebAndTopicNames)

---++ Setup
---+++ User subweb creation
If your TWiki site requires user registration, the registration mechanism needs to create the user's subweb instead of topic.

If there is no user registration on your TWiki site, there needs to be a mechanism to create a user subweb preferably on their own.

---+++ TWiki configuration
Needless to say, user subwebs requires =$TWiki::cfg{EnableHierarchicalWebs}= to be true in =lib/LocalSite.cfg=.
Otherwise, you cannot use subwebs period.

To enable user subwebs, you need to set =$TWiki::cfg{EnableUserSubwebs}= to true.
You can specify the topic name containing user preferences by =$TWiki::cfg{UserPrefsTopicName}=.
If it's not set, =WebHome= is assumed.

---+++ Customize web creation permission
If all of the following are true, you need to have an appropriate [[CanCreateWebMethod][canCreateWeb object method]] in the user mapping manager class.
   * Your TWiki doesn't have user registration
   * You lock down the %USERSWEB% web for tidyness
   * You want to have users create their subwebs on their own
