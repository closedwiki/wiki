TWiki (R) - the Open Source Enterprise Wiki and Web 2.0 Application Platform
===============================================

What is TWiki?
--------------

Welcome to TWiki, a flexible, powerful, and easy to use 
enterprise wiki, enterprise collaboration platform and 
knowledge management system. It is a Structured Wiki, 
typically used to run a project development space, a 
document management system, a knowledge base, or any 
other groupware tool, on an intranet or on the internet. 
Web content can be created collaboratively by using 
just a browser. Users without programming skills can create 
web applications. Developers can extend the functionality 
of TWiki with Plugins. TWiki fosters information flow 
within an organization; lets distributed teams work together
seamlessly and productively; and eliminates the 
one-webmaster syndrome of outdated intranet content.

Major companies like British Telecom, Sun Microsystems, 
Motorola, Yahoo and SAP depend on the TWiki platform to increase 
the productivity of their engineering teams. 

Features include automatic link generation, full text 
search, authorization based on groups, Web form handling, 
email notification of changes, file attachments to Web 
pages, revision control of pages and attachments, and 
more. A developers with begining level programming skills 
can develop Web2.0 Applications using server-side TWiki Plugin API. 


The GPLed TWiki software and over hundreds of Plugins can be 
downloaded from the TWiki.org web site, http://TWiki.org/.
