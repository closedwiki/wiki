---+!! Date Field Plugin

Provides support for a new type, =date=, in form fields. When a form field is set to this type it will no longer be editable by normal means, but only through a date selection popup.

---+ Usage

In a form definition, enter =date= where you would normally put =text= . For example:
<verbatim>
| Birthday | date | 0 | 1 April 2004 | A date |
</verbatim>
This will display an *uneditable* text field and a date selection icon that can be clicked to use the Mishoo Javascript calendar widget to insert a date. The =size= field is ignored.

If you want to use Javascript to create other data types in form fields, you can use this plugin as a model of how to do it.

	* Edit your =edit= template (in the templates directory). The actual file name to edit will depend on the skin you are using, but will usually be =edit.pattern.tmpl= or =edit.tmpl= or similar. Add the following line to the HEADER block:
<verbatim>
<!-- INCLUDEJSCALENDAR -->
</verbatim>
If you are using pattern skin ( =edit.pattern.tmpl= ), it should be added just after the line reading:
<verbatim>
%TMPL:DEF{"script"}%
</verbatim>
