%META:TOPICINFO{author="guest" date="1116006601" format="1.0" version="1.5"}%
---+!! <nop>%TOPIC%

Allows editing of preferences using fields predefined in a %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiForms. However, the edit fields are inlined in the text, similar to how tables are edited in TWiki:Plugins/EditTablePlugin.

%TOC%

Insert the =%<nop>EDITPREFERENCES%= variable (see below) anywhere in your topic. It will be replaced by a button that allows editing each preference in its predefined input format (or a text box, when no format is defined for this preference).

In edit mode, the edit button is replaced by save and cancel buttons, with their obvious meanings.

---++ Syntax Rules

	* =%<nop>EDITPREFERENCES{ "= _topic_ =" }%=
		* _topic_ references a TWiki.TWikiForms defining the format of the edit fields for preferences. It may be prefixed by a web.
		* If a preference setting is not mentioned in the form referenced by _topic_, a text input box of the specified length is provided.
		* Otherwise, the input can be through textareas, select, radio, checkbox, date, or text, as provided by %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiForms.

---++ Examples

	* =%<nop>EDITPREFERENCES{ "%<nop>TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPreferencesForm" }%= 

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>PREFERENCESPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

	* One line description, is shown in the %TWIKIWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Allows editing of preferences using fields predefined in a form

	* Length of the default input box
		* Set DEFAULTLENGTH = 30

	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0

---++ Known shortcomings

While the TWiki reference specifies that preferences are defined in a single line, the preference parser in =TWiki::Prefs::parseText= supports continuation lines, which are not yet supported in this plugin. Thus, all preferences should be defined in a single line.

When preferences are put inside a =&lt;verbatim&gt;= environment, they must be lifted out of this environment for editing. Thus it is advisable to only put a sequence of preference set instructions into such environment, without any accompanying subsequent or interspersed text.
