---++ initPlugin($topic, $web, $user, $installWeb) -> $boolean
   * =$topic= - the name of the topic in the current CGI query
   * =$web= - the name of the web in the current CGI query
   * =$user= - the login name of the user
   * =$installWeb= - the name of the web the plugin is installed in

REQUIRED

Called to initialise the plugin. If everything is OK, should return
a non-zero value. On non-fatal failure, should write a message
using TWiki::Func::writeWarning and return 0. In this case
%FAILEDPLUGINS% will indicate which plugins failed.

In the case of a catastrophic failure that will prevent the whole
installation from working safely, this handler may use 'die', which
will be trapped and reported in the browser.

You may also call =TWiki::Func::registerTagHandler= here to register
a function to handle variables that have standard TWiki syntax - for example,
=%MYTAG{"my param" myarg="My Arg"}%. You can also override internal
TWiki variable handling functions this way, though this practice is unsupported
and highly dangerous!

__Note:__ Please align variables names with the Plugin name, e.g. if 
your Plugin is called FooBarPlugin, name variables FOOBAR and/or 
FOOBARSOMETHING. This avoids namespace issues.
