---+ Settings for WysiwygPlugin that should common to most editor integrations
%STARTINCLUDE%
The *global* TWiki Variable =WYSIWYG_EXCLUDE= can be set to make the plugin sensitive to what is in a topic, before allowing it to be edited. You can set it up to veto an edit if the topic contains:
   * =html= - HTML tags (e.g. =&lt;div&gt;=, not including &lt;br&gt;), or 
   * =variables= - simple variables (e.g. =%<nop>VAR%=) or 
   * =calls= - TWiki variables with parameters e.g. =%<nop>VARIABLE{...}%=
   * =pre= blocks (=&lt;pre&gt;=)
   * HTML =comments= (=&lt;!--= ... =--&gt;=)
If the plugin detects an excluded construct in the topic, it will refuse to allow the edit and will redirect to the default editor.

If you excluded =calls= in =WYSIWYG_EXCLUDE=, you can still define a subset of TWiki variables that do *not* block edits. this is done in the *global* TWiki variable =WYSIWYG_EDITABLE_CALLS=, which should be a list of TWiki variable names separated by vertical bars, with no spaces, e.g: =* Set WYSIWYG_EDITABLE_CALLS = COMMENT|CALENDAR|INCLUDE=

You should set =WYSIWYG_EXCLUDE= and =WYSIWYG_EDITABLE_CALLS= in %MAINWEB%.TWikiPreferences, or in %WEBPREFSTOPIC% for each web.
