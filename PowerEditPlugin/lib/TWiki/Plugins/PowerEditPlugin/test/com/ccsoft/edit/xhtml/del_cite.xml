<!-- Purpose: To test the DEL Element with the cite attribute. The DEL element allows a author to mark up up sections of a document by deleting block-level or inline elements. The datetime attribute refers to a HTML document that documents the reasons for the deletion. -->

<!-- Expected result:  The phrase "when using the Photo Cartridge" is contained in the DEL element. The text should be shown as strikethrough text. -->
