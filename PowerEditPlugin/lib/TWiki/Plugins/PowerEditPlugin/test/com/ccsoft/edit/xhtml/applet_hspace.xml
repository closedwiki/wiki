<body>

<applet code="parbanner.class" codebase="../images" height="60"

width="300" hspace="5"><param name="message"

value="Scrolling banner text !!!" />

<param name="bgcolor" value="0000FF" />

</applet> Graphical browsers usually don't give you much space

between an applet and the text around it. HSPACE is used to add

white space on the left and right sides of the applet.The applet to

the left of this paragraph has HSPACE set to 5 pixels. <br

clear="LEFT" />

</applet> Graphical browsers usually don't give you much space

between an applet and the text around it. HSPACE is used to add

white space on the left and right sides of the applet. The applet

to the left of this paragraph has HSPACE set to 30 pixels. This

white space should be larger than the first example above.
