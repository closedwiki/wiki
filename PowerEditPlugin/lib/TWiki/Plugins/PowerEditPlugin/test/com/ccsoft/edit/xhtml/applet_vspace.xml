<applet code="parbanner.class" codebase="../images" height="60"

width="300" vspace="5"><param name="message"

value="Scrolling banner text !!!" />

<param name="bgcolor" value="0000FF" />

</applet> Graphical browsers usually don't give you much space

between an applet and the text around it. VSPACE is used to add

white space above and below the applet.The applet to the left of

this paragraph has VSPACE set to 5 pixels. <br clear="left" />

this paragraph has VSPACE set to 90 pixels. This white space should
