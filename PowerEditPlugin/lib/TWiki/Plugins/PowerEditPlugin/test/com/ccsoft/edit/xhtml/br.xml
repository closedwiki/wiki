<title>XHTML Functional -- BR</title>

<body>

Text with Line Breaks: <br />

 Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow <br />

 Creeps in this petty pace from day to day <br />

 To the last syllable of recorded time; <br />

 And all our yesterdays have lighted fools <br />

 The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! <br />

 Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, <br />

 That struts and frets his hour upon the stage <br />

 And then is heard no more. It is a tale <br />

 Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, <br />

 Signifying nothing.
