<!-- Purpose: To test the compact attribute of the unordered list element tag -->

<!-- Expected result: Two lists are used, the first list does not have the compact attribute and the second list does have the compact attribute defined. The visual ramification of using the compact attribute is to reduce the whitespace between list items. This attribute was never fully implemented and has subsequently been deprecated in HTML 4.0 -->
