<pre>

This is a line of text with no returns, breaks, or any other formatting associated with it. This should scroll off to the left. Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the King's horses and all the King's men Couldn't put Humpty together again. They called a doctor from the town. To come and fix poor Humpty's crown. He put a stitch in Humpty's leg. And bandaged up poor Humpty's egg. He used some tape and then some glue, And Humpty's now as good as new.
