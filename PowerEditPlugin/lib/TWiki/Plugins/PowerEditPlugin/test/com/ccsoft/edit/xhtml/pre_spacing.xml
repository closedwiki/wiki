<title>XHTML Functional -- PRE - SPACING</title>

<h4>PRE element using spaces for indentation and the BR element for

linefeed</h4>

<pre>



Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.<br />



          Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.<br />



          All the King's horses and all the King's men<br />



          Couldn't put Humpty together again.<br />



<br />



They called a doctor from the town.<br />



          To come and fix poor Humpty's crown.<br />



          He put a stitch in Humpty's leg.<br />



          And bandaged up poor Humpty's egg.<br />



<br />



He used some tape and then some glue,<br />



          And Humpty's now as good as new.
