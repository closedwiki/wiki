---++!! %TOPIC%

%TOC%

The %TOPIC% is a plug-in extension to TWiki that supports a Java 1.1 applet text editor. This applet works on most Java-enabled browsers (we haven't tested them <u>all</u>!).

The applet provides the same editing capabilities as a standard browser text area, and adds some common editor functionality:
	* Cut, Copy, Paste - the cut buffer is a static variable in the applet as there is no access to the system cut buffer from an applet. The cut buffer persists over different invocations of %TOPIC%, however, and you can always use the cut and paste functions in the browser menus to cut and paste outside the window.
	* Undo - undoes up to 100 commands per edit session.
	* Do again - repeats the last command.
	* Find, Replace - optionally use Emacs style regular expressions as provided by the gnu.regexp library. Replace is currently not smart enough to use field replacement, however.
	* Can be invoked in a separate frame.
	* Programmable buttons.
	* Convertor from HTML to TWiki markup

---++ Usage information
---+++ Configuring the Buttons and Hot keys
Buttons and hotkeys are all created by reading a user-defined topic which is set by the POWEREDIT_CONTROLS variable (see TWiki.TWikiVariables). If the variable is not set, the topic TWiki<nop>.PowerEditControls is read instead. This allows administrators to set default buttons and keys for the whole installation, for each web, and users can to set up their own controls for the editor by defining this variable in their personal topics. The variable must be set to the *full name* (including the web) of the topic that contains the control definitions; for example,
<pre>
      * <nop>Set POWEREDIT_CONTROLS = Main<nop>.My<nop>Power<nop>Edit<nop>Controls
</pre>
The control file contains a set of button panel and macro definitions. For example:
<pre>
macros
   "space" = " "
end
top
   "Tele type" = "/cut/=/paste/="
   "A Space"="/space/"
end
keys
   "^X" = "/cut/"
end
</pre>
In this example the first button in the top panel will be labelled "Tele type" and will perform the sequence /cut/=/paste/= - which will cut the currently selected text, enter an '=' sign, paste the text and enter another '=' sign. The second button will be labelled "A Space" and will execute the =space= macro, which in turn is defined to insert a ' ' character. The key "Ctrl+X" will be defined to perform the /cut/ command.
	* The four button panels are named "top", "bottom", "left" and "right"
	* There can be as many "macros" blocks as you like
	* In button blocks, the name is used as the label on the button
	* Control keys are denoted by a leading ^ character and must be in upper case e.g. ^A *not* ^a. Note that some browsers may not support key definitions.
	* The command string is a mixture of basic editor commands (see below) and text to be inserted.
	* The usual 'C' escapes are available in names and macro definitions i.e. prepending the character '\' will cause the next character to be interpreted literally. Note that '\/' will still be interpreted as '/' - to escape a '/' in the text, use a double-slash '//'.
	* Single-line comments can be inserted into the file by starting a line with the '<' character. Thus HTML tags on a line of their own will be ignored.
	* For some unexplained reason it isn't possible to use the %TOPIC% on the PowerEditControls file.

---+++ Commands</h3>
The following commands are basic to the editor and can be used in button definitions:
| *Name* | *Description* |
| /copy/ | Copy the currently selected text to the internal cut buffer |
| /cut/ | Cut the currently selected text to the internal cut buffer |
| /find/ | Invoke the find dialog |
| /paste/ | Paste the internal cut buffer. Will erase the current selection. |
| /undo/ | Undo the last edit |
| /redo/ | Repeats the last command executed (does *not* repeat typing) |
| /refind/ | Repeat the last find |
| /replace/ | Invoke the replace dialog |
| /rereplace/ | Repeat the last replacement |

---+++ Applet parameters
| *Parameter* | *Values* | *Description* |
| useframe | "yes" or "no" | Whether to use a separate window or not |
| editboxwidth | Number of columns | If useframe=yes, then defines the number of columns width of the edit area. Ignored if useframe=no. |
| editboxheight | Number of rows | If useframe=yes, then defines the number of rows height of the edit area. Ignored if useframe=no. |
| server | URL | The URL that the editor will use to pass information back to the server. |

It is a condition of use that any useful customisations are fed back to the %TOPIC%Dev page at http://www.twiki.org !

---++++ Known Problems
If you see a message in the text area suggesting that the topic is not locked for edit, try refreshing the page with the applet on (shift+Reload in Netscape, shift+F5 in IE). It's not really a problem, just a side-effect of the security checking in the applet.

---++++ Customisation
All the sources and unit tests are provided with the distribution, together with an Ant build file (see http://www.jakarta.org) should further customisation be required. The source.zip is shipped in the =lib/TWiki/Plugins/%TOPIC%= directory and when unzipped creates source, packages and test subdirectories. The =src= directory contains the PowerEdit applet sources, the =test= directory contains JUnit unit tests, and the =packages= directory contains the GNU 'regexp' packages, which is used by search and replace, and the kizna HTML parser.
