Template: twiki/defaultUrlHost
Type: string
_Default: http://localhost/
_Description: What is the top-level URL of the server TWiki runs under?
 For a normal install, this should be a URL for your web server's full
 name, which is used to construct urls on some pages.  The install will
 serve up the data by adding "twiki" to the end of this setting; it is also
 needed for certain redirections.

Template: twiki/wikiwebmaster
Type: string
_Default: webmaster@localhost
_Description: What is the email address of the webmaster for this TWiki?
 This email address gets mail for new user registration, and is listed on
 the "oops" page when things go wrong.

Template: twiki/samplefiles
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Install sample wiki universe on initial install?
 TWiki includes a complete "starter kit" which includes user registration
 pages, documentation, and tutorials.  If you're re-installing twiki after
 deleting the package and want to keep the old data, or if you've got a
 twiki data set from your own manual install, you should say "no" here.  On
 a normal initial install, say "yes", and a sample data set will be
 installed in /var/lib/twiki/data (and /var/www/twiki/pub).  (In either
 case, if data/Main/WebHome.txt is present, the starter kit will not be
 unpacked; you can look in /usr/share/doc/twiki/twiki-data.tar.gz (and
 twiki-pub.tar.gz) if you wish to install it manually or compare a new
 version.)

Template: twiki/apacheUserCreationNote
Type: note
_Description: Admin User Registration configuration required
 After you have created yourself a user, edit the Main.TWikiAdminGroup
 to restrict Admin privileges to that user.
