twiki (20011201-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * One step at a time - getting the trivial ones out of the way...
  * debian/postrm: ignore status of dpkg-statoverride --remove, in case
    we've been run twice (Closes: #151105)
  * debian/postinst: create /var/lib/twiki/data/.htpasswd if we have to
    (Closes: #151186, #148805) Don't let apacheconfig hang (since there's
    no way to mix apacheconfig and debconf) but lacking a sane perl debconf
    example, just cheat and force apacheconfig without restarting the server.
  * debian/control: bump wwwconfig-common dependency to a version that
    includes it apache-include-postrm.sh.
