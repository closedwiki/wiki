#
# Test script for testing TWiki refactorings, based on the concept
# that a refactoring should not change the rendered output from the
# various scripts.
#
# Note that THESE TESTS ARE AMAZINGLY CRUDE and should be backed up
# by unit tests in the refactored code. This is really just a sanity
# check, rather than a production quality test.
#
# Uses two installations, one using the old (golden) code, the other
# using the new test code.
#
# A subset of parameters is also tested; many are not, either because
# no-one can work out what they were for, or because nobody has been
# bothered yet. Contributors willing to write tests are always welcome!
#
# The basic strategy is to avoid dependencies on actual content wherever
# possible, and only use comparison between old and new to detect differences.
