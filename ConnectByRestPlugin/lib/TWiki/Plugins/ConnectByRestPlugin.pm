---+ package ConnectByRestPlugin

This is an empty TWiki plugin. It is a fully defined plugin, but is
disabled by default in a TWiki installation. Use it as a template
for your own plugins; see TWiki.TWikiPlugins for details.

This version of the !EmptyPlugin documents the handlers supported
by revision 1.2 of the Plugins API. See the documentation of =TWiki::Func=
for more information about what this revision number means, and how a
plugin can check it.

__NOTE:__ To interact with TWiki use ONLY the official API functions
in the TWiki::Func module. Do not reference any functions or
variables elsewhere in TWiki, as these are subject to change
without prior warning, and your plugin may suddenly stop
working.

For increased performance, all handlers except initPlugin are
disabled below. *To enable a handler* remove the leading DISABLE_ from
the function name. For efficiency and clarity, you should comment out or
delete the whole of handlers you don't use before you release your
plugin.

__NOTE:__ When developing a plugin it is important to remember that
TWiki is tolerant of plugins that do not compile. In this case,
the failure will be silent but the plugin will not be available.
See %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPlugins#FAILEDPLUGINS for error messages.

__NOTE:__ Defining deprecated handlers will cause the handlers to be 
listed in %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPlugins#FAILEDPLUGINS. See
%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPlugins#Handlig_deprecated_functions
for information on regarding deprecated handlers that are defined for
compatibility with older TWiki versions.

__NOTE:__ When writing handlers, keep in mind that these may be invoked
on included topics. For example, if a plugin generates links to the current
topic, these need to be generated before the afterCommonTagsHandler is run,
as at that point in the rendering loop we have lost the information that we
the text had been included from another topic.

REQUIRED

Called to initialise the plugin. If everything is OK, should return
a non-zero value. On non-fatal failure, should write a message
using TWiki::Func::writeWarning and return 0. In this case
%FAILEDPLUGINS% will indicate which plugins failed.

In the case of a catastrophic failure that will prevent the whole
installation from working safely, this handler may use 'die', which
will be trapped and reported in the browser.

You may also call =TWiki::Func::registerTagHandler= here to register
a function to handle variables that have standard TWiki syntax - for example,
=%MYTAG{"my param" myarg="My Arg"}%. You can also override internal
TWiki variable handling functions this way, though this practice is unsupported
and highly dangerous!

__Note:__ Please align variables names with the Plugin name, e.g. if 
your Plugin is called FooBarPlugin, name variables FOOBAR and/or 
FOOBARSOMETHING. This avoids namespace issues.

This handler is called before any other handler, and before it has been
determined if the plugin is enabled or not. Use it with great care!

If it returns a non-null error string, the plugin will be disabled.

Allows a plugin to set the username. Normally TWiki gets the username
from the login manager. This handler gives you a chance to override the
login manager.

Return the *login* name.

This handler is called very early, immediately after =earlyInitPlugin=.

   * =$meta= - meta-data object for the topic MAY BE =undef=
This handler is called by the code that expands %<nop>TAGS% syntax in
the topic body and in form fields. It may be called many times while
a topic is being rendered.

For variables with trivial syntax it is far more efficient to use
=TWiki::Func::registerTagHandler= (see =initPlugin=).

Plugins that have to parse the entire topic content should implement
this function. Internal TWiki
variables (and any variables declared using =TWiki::Func::registerTagHandler=)
are expanded _before_, and then again _after_, this function is called
to ensure all %<nop>TAGS% are expanded.

__NOTE:__ when this handler is called, &lt;verbatim> blocks have been
removed from the text (though all other blocks such as &lt;pre> and
&lt;noautolink> are still present).

__NOTE:__ meta-data is _not_ embedded in the text passed to this
handler. Use the =$meta= object.

This handler is called before TWiki does any expansion of it's own
internal variables. It is designed for use by cache plugins. Note that
when this handler is called, &lt;verbatim> blocks are still present
in the text.

__NOTE__: This handler is called once for each call to
=commonTagsHandler= i.e. it may be called many times during the
rendering of a topic.

This handler is after TWiki has completed expansion of %TAGS%.
It is designed for use by cache plugins. Note that when this handler
is called, &lt;verbatim> blocks are present in the text.

__NOTE__: This handler is called once for each call to

---++ preRenderingHandler( $text, \%map )
   * =$text= - text, with the head, verbatim and pre blocks replaced with placeholders
   * =\%removed= - reference to a hash that maps the placeholders to the removed blocks.

Handler called immediately before TWiki syntax structures (such as lists) are
processed, but after all variables have been expanded. Use this handler to 
process special syntax only recognised by your plugin.

Placeholders are text strings constructed using the tag name and a 
sequence number e.g. 'pre1', "verbatim6", "head1" etc. Placeholders are 
inserted into the text inside &lt;!--!marker!--&gt; characters so the 
text will contain &lt;!--!pre1!--&gt; for placeholder pre1.

Each removed block is represented by the block text and the parameters 
passed to the tag (usually empty) e.g. for
<verbatim>
<pre class='slobadob'>
XYZ
</pre>
the map will contain:
<pre>
$removed->{'pre1'}{text}:   XYZ
$removed->{'pre1'}{params}: class="slobadob"
</pre>
Iterating over blocks for a single tag is easy. For example, to prepend a 
line number to every line of every pre block you might use this code:
<verbatim>
foreach my $placeholder ( keys %$map ) {
    if( $placeholder =~ /^pre/i ) {
       my $n = 1;
       $map->{$placeholder}{text} =~ s/^/$n++/gem;
    }
}
</verbatim>

__NOTE__: This handler is called once for each rendered block of text i.e. 
it may be called several times during the rendering of a topic.

__NOTE:__ meta-data is _not_ embedded in the text passed to this
handler.

This handler is called each time a topic is saved.

__NOTE:__ meta-data is embedded in =$text= (using %META: tags). If you modify
the =$meta= object, then it will override any changes to the meta-data
embedded in the text. Modify *either* the META in the text *or* the =$meta=
object, never both. You are recommended to modify the =$meta= object rather
than the text, as this approach is proof against changes in the embedded
text format.

---++ mergeHandler( $diff, $old, $new, \%info ) -> $text
Try to resolve a difference encountered during merge. The =differences= 
array is an array of hash references, where each hash contains the 
following fields:
   * =$diff= => one of the characters '+', '-', 'c' or ' '.
      * '+' - =new= contains text inserted in the new version
      * '-' - =old= contains text deleted from the old version
      * 'c' - =old= contains text from the old version, and =new= text
        from the version being saved
      * ' ' - =new= contains text common to both versions, or the change
        only involved whitespace
   * =$old= => text from version currently saved
   * =$new= => text from version being saved
   * =\%info= is a reference to the form field description { name, title,
     type, size, value, tooltip, attributes, referenced }. It must _not_
     be wrtten to. This parameter will be undef when merging the body
     text of the topic.

Plugins should try to resolve differences and return the merged text. 
For example, a radio button field where we have 
={ diff=>'c', old=>'Leafy', new=>'Barky' }= might be resolved as 
='Treelike'=. If the plugin cannot resolve a difference it should return 
undef.

The merge handler will be called several times during a save; once for 
each difference that needs resolution.

If any merges are left unresolved after all plugins have been given a 
chance to intercede, the following algorithm is used to decide how to 
merge the data:
   1 =new= is taken for all =radio=, =checkbox= and =select= fields to 
     resolve 'c' conflicts
   1 '+' and '-' text is always included in the the body text and text
     fields
   1 =&lt;del>conflict&lt;/del> &lt;ins>markers&lt;/ins>= are used to 
     mark 'c' merges in text fields

The merge handler is called whenever a topic is saved, and a merge is 
required to resolve concurrent edits on a topic.

proposed by the core, plus any modifications made by other plugins that also
implement this method that come earlier in the plugins list.
<verbatim>
$headers->{expires} = '+1h';

Note that this is the HTTP header which is _not_ the same as the HTML

---++ renderFormFieldForEditHandler($name, $type, $size, $value, $attributes, $possibleValues) -> $html

This handler is called before built-in types are considered. It generates 
the HTML text rendering this form field, or false, if the rendering 
should be done by the built-in type handlers.
   * =$name= - name of form field
   * =$type= - type of form field (checkbox, radio etc)
   * =$size= - size of form field
   * =$value= - value held in the form field
   * =$attributes= - attributes of form field 
   * =$possibleValues= - the values defined as options for form field, if
     any. May be a scalar (one legal value) or a ref to an array
     (several legal values)

Return HTML text that renders this field. If false, form rendering
continues by considering the built-in types.

*Since:* TWiki::Plugins::VERSION 1.1

Note that since TWiki-4.2, you can also extend the range of available
types by providing a subclass of =TWiki::Form::FieldDefinition= to implement
the new type (see =TWiki::Plugins.JSCalendarContrib= and
=TWiki::Plugins.RatingContrib= for examples). This is the preferred way to
extend the form field types, but does not work for TWiki < 4.2.

---++ renderWikiWordHandler($linkText, $hasExplicitLinkLabel, $web, $topic) -> $linkText
   * =$linkText= - the text for the link i.e. for =[<nop>[Link][blah blah]]=
     it's =blah blah=, for =BlahBlah= it's =BlahBlah=, and for [[Blah Blah]] it's =Blah Blah=.
   * =$hasExplicitLinkLabel= - true if the link is of the form =[<nop>[Link][blah blah]]= (false if it's ==<nop>[Blah]] or =BlahBlah=)
   * =$web=, =$topic= - specify the topic being rendered (only since TWiki 4.2)

Called during rendering, this handler allows the plugin a chance to change
the rendering of labels used for links.

Return the new link text.

---++ completePageHandler($html, $httpHeaders)

This handler is called on the ingredients of every page that is
output by the standard TWiki scripts. It is designed primarily for use by
cache and security plugins.
   * =$html= - the body of the page (normally &lt;html>..$lt;/html>)
   * =$httpHeaders= - the HTTP headers. Note that the headers do not contain
     a =Content-length=. That will be computed and added immediately before
     the page is actually written. This is a string, which must end in \n\n.

*Since:* TWiki::Plugins::VERSION 1.2

---++ restUpdateformfield

This REST function is used to update a single form field of a specified topic. 

   * =$session=   - The TWiki object associated to this session
