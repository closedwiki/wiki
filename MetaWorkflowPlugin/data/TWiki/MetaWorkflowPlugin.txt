%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

---++ Introduction

This plugin defines a workflow based on updated meta data in a number of topics. It was originally written for use with the [[TWiki:Plugins.WorkflowPlugin][WorkflowPlugin]], but can also be used to create a workflow using %SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiForms or any other changing meta data. To view the meta data of a topic, append ==?raw=debug== to the URL (i.e. %SCRIPTURL{"view"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?raw=debug).

---++ Usage

To use this plugin, you must first create a Meta Worflow Definition table. This can either be in the topic you want to display the message from, or in another topic specified by the following setting:
<verbatim>
   * Set METAWORKFLOWDEFINITION = Web.SomeTopic
</verbatim>

The meta workflow definition table starts with the =%<nop>METAWORKFLOW{...}%= variable, which can have the following parameters:

| *Parameter* | *Comment* | *Default* |
| =type= | The type of meta data. | required |
| =name= | The name of the meta data type. Needed if you are working with multiple entries of the same type (i.e. for FIELD). | none |
| =key= | The key of the meta data you want to match (i.e. value). | =name= |

The table itself must follow immediately after the =%<nop>METAWORKFLOW{...}%= variable. It is made up of three columns, as explained below.

| *Topic* | *Value* | *Message* |
| _The topic where the meta data is coming from._ | _Defines what the value needs to be equal to before moving to the next row of the table._ | _The message displayed if the value is not equal._ |

The topic column can also contain the word =FINAL=, which will display a message once the workflow has been completed. The plugin will ignore header rows.

The message is displayed using the =%<nop>METAWORKFLOWCURRENT%= variable. This needs to be in the same topic as the definition table, or in a topic with the =METAWORKFLOWDEFINITION= setting.

---++ Example

A working example of using this plugin to create a workflow based on the value of a form field can be found at [[Sandbox.MetaWorkflowExample]], once you have installed and enabled the plugin.

---++ Plugin Settings

   * To suppress warnings on your topic, use the following (Note: only has effect on the topic it is set on):
<verbatim>
      * Set METAWORKFLOWWARNING = off
</verbatim>

   * One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Define a workflow based on updated meta data (such as form fields, or meta data from another plugin)
