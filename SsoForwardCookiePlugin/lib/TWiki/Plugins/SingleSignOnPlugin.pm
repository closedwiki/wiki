Plugin to add single sign-on handler for external HTTP requests

# Name of this Plugin, only used in this module

require TWiki::Plugins; # For the API version

# $VERSION is referred to by TWiki, and is the only global variable that
# *must* exist in this package. It should always be Rev enclosed in dollar
# signs so that TWiki can determine the checked-in status of the plugin.
# It is used by the build automation tools, so you should leave it alone.
our $VERSION = '$Rev$';

# This is a free-form string you can use to "name" your own plugin version.
# It is *not* used by the build automation tools, but is reported as part
# of the version number in PLUGINDESCRIPTIONS. Add a release date in ISO
# format (preferred) or a release number such as '1.3'.
our $RELEASE = '1.0';

# One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
our $SHORTDESCRIPTION = 'Plugin to add single sign-on handler for external HTTP requests';

# You must set $NO_PREFS_IN_TOPIC to 0 if you want your plugin to use preferences
# stored in the plugin topic. This default is required for compatibility with
# older plugins, but imposes a significant performance penalty, and
# is not recommended. Instead, use $TWiki::cfg entries set in LocalSite.cfg, or
# if you want the users to be able to change settings, then use standard TWiki
# preferences that can be defined in your Main.TWikiPreferences and overridden
# at the web and topic level.
our $NO_PREFS_IN_TOPIC = 1;

# Define other global package variables

---++ initPlugin($topic, $web, $user, $installWeb) -> $boolean
   * =$topic= - the name of the topic in the current CGI query
   * =$web= - the name of the web in the current CGI query
   * =$user= - the login name of the user
   * =$installWeb= - the name of the web the plugin is installed in

REQUIRED

Called to initialise the plugin. If everything is OK, should return
a non-zero value. On non-fatal failure, should write a message
using TWiki::Func::writeWarning and return 0. In this case
%FAILEDPLUGINS% will indicate which plugins failed.

In the case of a catastrophic failure that will prevent the whole
installation from working safely, this handler may use 'die', which
will be trapped and reported in the browser.

You may also call =TWiki::Func::registerTagHandler= here to register
a function to handle variables that have standard TWiki syntax - for example,
=%MYVAR{"my param" myarg="My Arg"}%. You can also override internal
TWiki variable handling functions this way, though this practice is unsupported
and highly dangerous!

__Note:__ Please align variables names with the Plugin name, e.g. if 
your Plugin is called FooBarPlugin, name variables FOOBAR and/or 
FOOBARSOMETHING. This avoids namespace issues.
