---++ Usage

On the intranet, users enjoy single sign-on for almost all the sites including locally installed TWiki. In order to use an intranet URL for =%<nop>INCLUDE{...}%=, the single sign-on token needs to be forwarded to the included URL.

This plugin hooks any HTTP requests from TWiki to external resources inside the intranet, so that the credential token in the cookie from the browser is forwarded to the destination.

The administrator needs to configure the following values via the [[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%][configure]] script.
   * =$cfg{Plugins}{SsoForwardCookiePlugin}{Domains}= (required, separated by commas or spaces)
      * List of domain names to match each requested URL to determine if cookies should be forwarded.
      * If a specified domain starts with a dot (.), it matches any subdomains. Otherwise, only the exact domain is matched.
      * Alternatively, a topic name can be specified as =topic:<i>Web</i>.<i>Topic</i>=. For example,
         * =$cfg{Plugins}{SsoForwardCookiePlugin}{Domains} = "topic:%<nop>SYSTEMWEB%.SsoForwardCookieDomains"=
            * where variables with percent signs (%) will be expanded; or
         * =$cfg{Plugins}{SsoForwardCookiePlugin}{Domains} = "topic:SsoForwardCookieDomains"=
            * if only a topic name is given, it defaults to [[%SYSTEMWEB%.WebHome][%<nop>SYSTEMWEB%]].
      * The specified topic is expected to contain domain names in the table format as below. This plugin comes with an example %SYSTEMWEB%.SsoForwardCookieDomains topic, which can be edited and used.
        <verbatim>
| *Domain* |
| example.com |
| .example.com |
</verbatim>
   * =$cfg{Plugins}{SsoForwardCookiePlugin}{CookieNames}= (required, separated by commas or spaces)
      * Names of cookies that are allowed to be forwarded. Specify a single star (*) to forward all the cookies, although it is not recommended.

For troubleshooting, try turning on the =Debug= flag:
   * =$cfg{Plugins}{SsoForwardCookiePlugin}{Debug} = 1;=

---++ Examples

Suppose your TWiki server is running at =http://twiki.example.com=. In the example.com intranet, there are many single sign-on sites, such as =http://abc.example.com=, =http://xyz.example.com=, and so on.

Then the =Domains= configuration should be set to ".example.com" (notice: the leading dot), where any subdomains under =.example.com= are considered as intranet sites.

%I% Note: If the =Domains= configuration is set without the leading dot, only the exactly matched domain is considered as the single sigin-on target. For example, if it is set to "example.com", the credential forwarding takes place for =http://example.com/...= but not for =http://abc.example.com/...=.

When =%<nop>INCLUDE{"http://xyz.example.com/..."}%= is used, the credential token that comes from the browser to TWiki will be forwarded from TWiki to =xyz.example.com=.

The name of the cookie values must also be configured properly. If your intranet uses !SiteMinder for example, the cookie name should be set to "SMSESSION".
If you prefer to forward all the cookies that the browser sends to TWiki, set it to a single star (*), although it is not recommended.

---++ Technical Information

These are the expected targets that are affected by this plugin:
   * =%<nop>INCLUDE{...}%=
   * =TWiki::Func::getExternalResource()=
   * =TWiki::Func::postExternalResource()=

The plugin extracts the cookie value from the =HTTP_COOKIE= environment variable. It does not work if this environment variable is not visible from the TWiki script (due to Apache configs, modules, or any other factors).

%I% If you see the error "This site does not allow %<nop>INCLUDE% of URLs", check =$cfg{INCLUDE}{AllowURLs}= to see if it is enabled (set to 1 in =lib/LocalSite.cfg=).

---++ Installation Instructions

__Note:__ You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this plugin. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the plugin on the TWiki server.

   * For an __automated installation__, run the [[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%][configure]] script and follow "Find More Extensions" in the in the __Extensions__ section.

      * Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:
        | *File:* | *Description:* |
        | ==data/TWiki/SsoForwardCookiePlugin.txt== | Plugin topic |
        | ==lib/TWiki/Plugins/SsoForwardCookiePlugin.pm== | Plugin Perl module |
      * Set the ownership of the extracted directories and files to the webserver user.
      * Install the dependencies.

   * Plugin __configuration and testing__: 
      * Run the [[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%][configure]] script and enable the plugin in the __Plugins__ section.
