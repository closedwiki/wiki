# Sample '.htaccess' file for 'pub' subdirectory

# Controls access to TWiki 'pub' subdirectory - copy this into 'pub', 
# naming it '.htaccess', to have Apache use it.

# This is useful if you install TWiki on a web host, or an intranet host
# where you can't edit the Apache http.conf file.  If you can edit the
# http.conf file, just set the 'Allow from all' there (or locate these
# directories outside the Web-visible directory tree.)

# Allow all access
Allow from all

# Deny people from looking at the index
# Bare in mind that this is largely inadequate
# See http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/SecuringAttachments

# If you think you have a solution it is in your best interests to share it 
# so others can test your idea.
