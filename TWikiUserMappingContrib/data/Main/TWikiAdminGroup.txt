   * Member list:
      * Set GROUP = ATWikiUser
   * Persons/group who can change the list:
      * Set ALLOWTOPICCHANGE = TWikiAdminGroup

__Related topics:__ %WIKIUSERSTOPIC%, TWikiGroups, %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiAccessControl

__%X% NOTE:__ You can login as the built-in Admin user using the password set in configure.
   * First you need to be logged in as a normal registered user
   * Then change your current status by authenticating as _TWikiAdminGroup_ and using the password set in configure using the special [[%SCRIPTURL{login}%?sudo=sudo][temporary admin login]].
   * Once you are a member of the !TWikiAdminGroup you automatically get admin previledges when you do a normal login.

__%X% NOTE:__ If you happen to lock yourself out of <nop>TWikiAdminGroup during setup activities or have forgotten the configure password, you can edit this group topic at file system level using any text file editor (as a last resort.)
