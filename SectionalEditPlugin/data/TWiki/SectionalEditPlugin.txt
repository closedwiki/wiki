---++ Sectional Edit Plugin
_Discussion of this plugin can be found in [[TWiki:Plugins.%TOPIC%Dev][%TOPIC%Dev]]._

This plugin allows the user to break a topic into sections which can be edited individually.

%X% There is a known problem in that if the last character in a section is a TWiki markup, the markup will be rendered verbatim. Nevertheless, due to many requests I have put the plugin here without having addressed this final issue.

---+++ Syntax Rules

To enable editing of:
	* *One or more sections,* insert a =&lt;sectionbreak/&gt;= tag on the line above each  heading marker (=---+=) or deeper;
	* *Any portion of a topic,* enclose that portion between =&lt;sectionedit&gt;= and =&lt;/sectionedit&gt;= tags;
	* *The entire topic,* insert the =&lt;editsections/&gt;= tag on the first line of the topic; or
	* *On all topics, by default,* set the preference flag =EDITSECTIONS= to true (in either user or web preferences). With this approach, the preference variable =SECTIONDEPTH= (again set in either user or web) controls the level of headings down to which SectionalEditPlugin will apply (with all lower headings/sections being included in that section).

*NOTE:* You *cannot* mix these three methods on a single page.

*NOTE:* This breaks the page up at the lowest level, meaning that you can't put section breaks inside tables, lists, etc. as it breaks the whole page up into a table.

---+++ <nop>%TOPIC% Settings

	* One line description, is shown in the %TWIKIWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Allows the user to break a topic into sections for individual editing.

	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0

	* Edit Label (may also be an =&lt;img&gt;= tag):
		* Set LABEL = Edit

	* A comma separated list of skins *NOT* to section (you'll probably want the print skin here):
		* Set SKIPSKIN = print, plain

	* Style for marking sections. This is either an inline style definition or a class reference. If left blank, a bar of BGCOLOR is placed next to the sections that can be edited. Style definitions may also be placed with the =&lt;sectionedit&gt;= tag to give individual sections a different style.
		* Set STYLE = style="border: black thin dotted"
		* #Set STYLE = class="twikiTopicActions"
		* #Set STYLE = 

	* Placement of the Edit Label (below or above, only valid together with the STYLE setting)
		* Set PLACEMENT = Below

	* Left or Right Justification of Edit Label
		* Set JUSTIFICATION = Right

	* Edit Bar Background Color:
		* Set BGCOLOR = silver
