---++ Sectional Editing Plugin

This plugin allows the user to break a topic up into sections which can be edited individually.

---+++ Syntax Rules

Insert a &lt;sectionbreak/&gt; tag between sections.

*NOTE:* This breaks the page up at the lowest level, meaning that you can't put section breaks inside tables, lists, etc. as it breaks the whole page up into a table.

---+++ <nop>%TOPIC% Settings

	* One line description, is shown in the %TWIKIWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Allows the user to break a topic into sections for individual editing.

	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0

	* Edit Bar Background Color:
		* Set BGCOLOR = %WEBBGCOLOR%

	* Edit Bar Label (may also be an &lt;img&gt; tag):
		* Set LABEL = e

	* A comma separated list of skins *NOT* to section (you'll probably want the print skin here):
		* Set SKIPSKIN = print

	* Left or Right Justification of Edit Bar
		* Set JUSTIFICATION = Left

	* Edit Box Width, Height, Style (set to width: 99% for full width, auto to disable).
		* Set EDITBOXWIDTH = 70
		* Set EDITBOXHEIGHT = 27
		* Set EDITBOXSTYLE = width: 54%;

---+++ Plugin Installation Instructions

	1 Download the zip file.
	1 Unzip the zip file into your twiki web folder.
