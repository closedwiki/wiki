---++ Build & Install Modules
The Build.pm module can be used to create a really simple build process for your plugin, addon or contrib module, including build, test, install, release and upload targets. The advantage of this module is that it defines a standard build procedure for plugins, so you won't get file names wrong or get the list of files in the plugin topic wrong either. The easiest way to use the module is to copy the =build.pl= file from the =lib/TWiki/Contrib/BuildContrib/= into your own plugin subdirectory. Note that the test target assumes you are using Test::Unit. =Build.pm= has only been tested on Linux, but should work with cygwin OK.

Note this is a _build_ module for use by developers, not an _install_ module for end users. The intent is that =Build.pm= will be extended to _auto-generate_ the installer for the plugin as part of the release process. We're not quite there yet, but watch this space!

The build environment also requires =curl= if you want to use the =upload= target.

Note that this topic and all the embedded POD documentation are generated using this build module.

The build environment does _not_ assume the use of CVS, though it is highly recommended.

---++ Test Fixtures
The are a number of test fixtures in the repository that can be used for testing plugins with =Test::Unit=. The fixtures replace the =TWiki::Func=, =TWiki::Store= and TWiki modules, allowing a stand-alone unit test suite to be built for the plugin. The easiest way to use the fixtures is to copy the tests from an existing plugin that uses them - for example, CommentPlugin, ActionTrackerPlugin, WebDAVPlugin or FormQueryPlugin - and modify the tests appropriately for your plugin.

The fixtures do not replace _all_ of the TWiki core functionality, just those pieces used by the plugins. If you find a piece is missing, and you need it, please feel free to extend the fixtures on condition that you check your improvements back in.

---++ <nop>TWikiCLI - command line interface to TWiki

Note that the <nop>TWikiCLI (BuildContrib/contrib/bin/twikicli) feature is strictly experimental.
Its interfaces are likely to change and it may be dropped completely.

Purpose:
	1 To replace all twiki command line scripts with a single interface script environment

Its purpose is to seek out classes in the path that can do its bidding. Only one class is provided
at present: TWikiCLI::Extension, so only the "twikicli extension" currently does anything.

Usage:
	1 Add BuildContrib/contrib/bin to your PATH. This contains one uber-command:
		* twikicli

You can use "twikicli extension install TWiki:Plugins.TWikiExtension "
	* e.g.:
		* twikicli extension install DistributionContrib
		* twikicli extension install TWikiReleaseTrackerPlugin

Prerequisite environment, assuming 
	1 you have your development/test TWiki installs at (URI) =athens.twiki.com=, =beijing.twiki.com=, =beta.twiki.com= and =bleeding.twiki.com=
	1 you have your development CVS checkout at =$HOME/twikiplugindev/twikiplugins=
	1 You are using your bleeding edge as the source of contrib libraries for plugin testing
<verbatim>
export TWIKI_HOMES="athens.twiki.com/twiki beijing.twiki.com/twiki beta.twiki.com/twiki bleeding.twiki.com"
export TWIKI_LIBSDIR=$HOME/twikiplugindev/twikiplugins/
export TWIKI_RUNTIMELIB=/usr/local/twiki/bleeding/twiki/lib
export TWIKI_LIBS=`echo $TWIKI_LIBSDIR*/lib/ | tr " " ":"`:$TWIKI_RUNTIMELIB
</verbatim>
	
Development notes:
	1 This is a very rough implementation - I built one myself as I could not find one on CPAN. If
	we find one we will trash the implementation. Hopefully we will be able to keep the functionality though
	
---++ Support scripts
=conformance_analyser.pl= is a perl script that analyses the conformance of plugins to the API and packaging standards. It is driven from the zips downloadable from twiki.org.
