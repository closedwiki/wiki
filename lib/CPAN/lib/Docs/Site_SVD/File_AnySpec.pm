=head2 3.3 Changes

Changes are as follows: 

=over 4

=item Test-TestUtil-0.01

Originated

=item Test-TestUtil-0.02

Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse" <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
test run

t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....Bareword "fspec_dirs" not allowed 
while "strict subs" in use at 

  /net/sunu991/disc1/.cpanplus/5.8.0/build/Test-TestUtil-0.01/blib/lib/Test/TestUtil.pm line 56.

Changed line 56 from

 my @dirs = (fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

to

 my @dirs = ($fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

This error is troublesome since the test passed on my system using Active Perl
under Microsoft NT. It should never have passed. 
This error is in a core method, I<fspec2fspec>,
that changes file specifications from one operating system
to another operating system.
This method has been in service unchanged for some time.

=item Test-TestUtil-0.03

Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse" <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
test run

PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/perl/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t
t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....# Test 18 got: '$VAR1 = '';
' (t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t at line 540 fail #17)
#    Expected: '$VAR1 = '\\=head1 Title Page

The I<pm2datah> method is not returning any data for Test 18. This will also cause
the test of I<pm2data>, test 19 to fail.
The I<pm2datah> is searching for the string "\n__DATA__\n".

The "\n" character on Perl is a logical end of line character sequence.
The "\n" end of line is different on Mr. Smokehouse's Unix operating system
than on my Windows NT operating system.
The test file was created under MSWin32 and uses a MSWin32 "\n".
Under UNIX, I<pm2datah> method will look for the Unix "\n"
and there will not be any.

Changed "\n__DATA__\n" to /[\012\015]__DATA__/. 

During the clean-up for CPAN, broke the I<format_hash_table>
method for tables in hash of hash format. 
Fixed the break, added test 29 to the I<t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t>
test script for this
feature, and added a discusssion of this feature in
POD discription for I<format_hash_table>

=item Test-TestUtil-0.04

Our old friend visits again - DOS and UNIX text file incompatibility

This impacts other modules. We have to examine all modules for
this portability defect and correct any found defects.

Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse" <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
and Kingpin <mthurn@carbon> test runs.

On Mr. Smokehouse's run email the got: VAR1 clearly showed extra white space
line that is not present in the expected: VAR1. 
In Mr. Kingpin's run the got: VAR1 and expected: VAR1 look visually the same.
However, the Unix found a difference(s) and failed the test.

For Mr. Smokehouse's run:

PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t

 Software Version Description


 for


  File::AnySpec - Manipulate file specifications for foreign operating systems

What we have before, was a totally "failure to communicate." aka Cool Hand Luke. 
VAR1 was empty. Now VAR1 has something. It is not completely dead.
One probable cause is the Unix operating system must be producing two Unix \012 new lines 
for a Microsoft single newline \015\012.
Without being able to examine the test with a debugger, the only way to verify
this is to provide the fix and see if the problem goes away when this great group
of testers try for the fourth time. 

Revised I<fin> method to take a handle, change I<pm2datah> method handle,  I<$fh>, 
to binary by adding a I<binmode $fh> statement, and pass the actual
thru the I<fin> method for test 18.

Use I<fin($fh)> to read in the data for I<pm2data>, test 19 Unit Under Test (UUT),
instead of using the raw file handle.

The I<fin> method takes any \015\012 combination and changes it into the 
logical Perl new line, I<"\n">, for the current operating system.

A second thing that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
"Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is descriptive
of what the routines actually do or what the module implements. I would
recommend renaming them to something closer to your other modules, maybe
"Test::SVDMaker::Util" and "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not
seem to be specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
(format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might even better
live in another module namespace, "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like
that.

Broke away all the file related methods from Test::TestUtil and
created this module File::FileUtil so the module name is
more descriptive of the methods within the module.

=item *

Broke the smart nl code out of the fin method and made it
is own separate method, smart_nl method.

Perl, as Perl already does smart newline handling, (even though with the
advent of 5.8 even Unix-people have to learn the word "binmode" now :-)) 

The only place where I see Perl does smart newline handling is
the crlf IO displine introduce in Perl 5.6.  The File::FileUtil has
a use 5.001 so that 5.6 Perl built-ins cannot be used. Added comment
to smart_nl that for users with 5.6 Perl that it may be better to
use the built-in crlf IO discipline.

=item *

For the load_package method that uses a eval "require $package" to load the
package, the $@ does not capture all the warnings and error messages,
at least not with ActiveState Perl.  Added code the captures also the
warnings, by temporaily reassigning  $SIG(__WARN__), and added these
to the $@ error messages.

=item *

Added two new tests to verify the NOGO paths for the for the load_package
method.  One tests for load module failure looking for all the possilbe
information on why the module did not load. The other verifies that
the vocabulary is present after the loading the module.
This information is very helpful when you must remote debug a load
failure from CPAN testing whose is running on a different platform.

=item File-FileUtil-0.02

Added the method I<hex_dump>.

=item File-FileUtil-0.03

=over 4

=item test_lib2inc

Returns to parent directory of
the first t directory going up
from the test script instead of the
t directory.

=item find_t_roots

Added the function find_t_roots that
returns the parent directory of all
the directories in @INC

=back

=item File-AnySpec-0.01

Removed the methods for converting a
program module specification to its
absolute file from the
"File::FileUtil" module to their own module
"File::AnySpec" module.
The module name is now more descriptive
of the routines in the module.

Corrective Action: 
This module uses the "SelfLoader" module that loads functions from the __DATA__ section.
There is a one at the end of the __DATA__ section but not one at the end of the code.
Added a 1 at the end of the code section in hopes this will cure this error.

Very pleased the way the File::Package funcstions and the "Test" dual input ok function
remotely reported the error messages from loading the "File::AnySpec" module with a
require.

=item File-AnySpec-0.03

=item File-AnySpec-0.04

Change test so that test support program modules resides in distribution
directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory. 
Because they are no longer in the lib directory, 
test support files will not be installed as a pre-condition for the 
test of this module.
The test of this module will precede immediately.
The test support files in the tlib directory will vanish after
the installtion.

=item File-AnySpec-0.05

Added subroutine interfaces.

Use Archive::TarGzip 0.02 that uses modd 777 for directories instead of 666. Started to get
emails from Unix about untar not being able to change to
a directory with mod of 666.

=item File-AnySpec-0.06

Added the 'Data-Secs2' to the 'tlib' test library.
Upgraded to the 'Test-Tech' module that uses the 'Data-Secs2' module.

The lastest build of C<Test::STDmaker> expects the test library in the same
directory as the test script.
Coordiated with the lastest Test::STDmaker by moving the
test library from tlib to C<t/File>, the same directory as the test script
and deleting the test library File::TestPath program module.

Changed from the obsolete C<File::PM2File> program module to 
the C<File::Where> program module.

There is still much work needed to ensure the quality 
of this module as follows:

=over 4

=item *

State the functional requirements for each method 
including not only the GO paths but also what to
expect for the NOGO paths

=item *

All the tests are GO path tests. Should add
NOGO tests.

=item *

Add the requirements addressed as I<# R: >
comment to the tests

=item *

Write a program to build a matrix to trace
test step to the requirements and vice versa by
parsing the I<# R: > comments.
Automatically insert the matrix in the
module POD.

Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse" <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
test run

t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....Bareword "fspec_dirs" not allowed 
while "strict subs" in use at 

  /net/sunu991/disc1/.cpanplus/5.8.0/build/Test-TestUtil-0.01/blib/lib/Test/TestUtil.pm line 56.

Changed line 56 from

 my @dirs = (fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

to

 my @dirs = ($fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

This error is troublesome since the test passed on my system using Active Perl
under Microsoft NT. It should never have passed. 
This error is in a core method, I<fspec2fspec>,
that changes file specifications from one operating system
to another operating system.
This method has been in service unchanged for some time.

\=item Test-TestUtil-0.03

Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse" <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
test run

PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/perl/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t

#    Expected: '$VAR1 = '\\=head1 Title Page

The I<pm2datah> method is not returning any data for Test 18. This will also cause
the test of I<pm2data>, test 19 to fail.
The I<pm2datah> is searching for the string "\n__DATA__\n".

The "\n" character on Perl is a logical end of line character sequence.
The "\n" end of line is different on Mr. Smokehouse's Unix operating system
than on my Windows NT operating system.
The test file was created under MSWin32 and uses a MSWin32 "\n".
Under UNIX, I<pm2datah> method will look for the Unix "\n"
and there will not be any.

Changed "\n__DATA__\n" to /[\012\015]__DATA__/. 

During the clean-up for CPAN, broke the I<format_hash_table>
method for tables in hash of hash format. 
Fixed the break, added test 29 to the I<t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t>
test script for this
feature, and added a discusssion of this feature in
POD discription for I<format_hash_table>

\=item Test-TestUtil-0.04

Our old friend visits again - DOS and UNIX text file incompatibility

This impacts other modules. We have to examine all modules for
this portability defect and correct any found defects.

Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse" <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
and Kingpin <mthurn@carbon> test runs.

On Mr. Smokehouse's run email the got: VAR1 clearly showed extra white space
line that is not present in the expected: VAR1. 
In Mr. Kingpin's run the got: VAR1 and expected: VAR1 look visually the same.
However, the Unix found a difference(s) and failed the test.

For Mr. Smokehouse's run:

What we have before, was a totally "failure to communicate." aka Cool Hand Luke. 
VAR1 was empty. Now VAR1 has something. It is not completely dead.
One probable cause is the Unix operating system must be producing two Unix \012 new lines 
for a Microsoft single newline \015\012.
Without being able to examine the test with a debugger, the only way to verify
this is to provide the fix and see if the problem goes away when this great group
of testers try for the fourth time. 

Revised I<fin> method to take a handle, change I<pm2datah> method handle,  I<$fh>, 
to binary by adding a I<binmode $fh> statement, and pass the actual
thru the I<fin> method for test 18.

Use I<fin($fh)> to read in the data for I<pm2data>, test 19 Unit Under Test (UUT),
instead of using the raw file handle.

The I<fin> method takes any \015\012 combination and changes it into the 
logical Perl new line, I<"\n">, for the current operating system.

A second thing that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
"Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is descriptive
of what the routines actually do or what the module implements. I would
recommend renaming them to something closer to your other modules, maybe
"Test::SVDMaker::Util" and "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not
seem to be specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
(format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might even better
live in another module namespace, "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like
that.

Broke away all the file related methods from Test::TestUtil and
created this module File::FileUtil so the module name is
more descriptive of the methods within the module.

\=item *

Broke the smart nl code out of the fin method and made it
is own separate method, smart_nl method.

Perl, as Perl already does smart newline handling, (even though with the
advent of 5.8 even Unix-people have to learn the word "binmode" now :-)) 

The only place where I see Perl does smart newline handling is
the crlf IO displine introduce in Perl 5.6.  The File::FileUtil has
a use 5.001 so that 5.6 Perl built-ins cannot be used. Added comment
to smart_nl that for users with 5.6 Perl that it may be better to
use the built-in crlf IO discipline.

\=item *

For the load_package method that uses a eval "require $package" to load the
package, the $@ does not capture all the warnings and error messages,
at least not with ActiveState Perl.  Added code the captures also the
warnings, by temporaily reassigning  $SIG(__WARN__), and added these
to the $@ error messages.

\=item *

Added two new tests to verify the NOGO paths for the for the load_package
method.  One tests for load module failure looking for all the possilbe
information on why the module did not load. The other verifies that
the vocabulary is present after the loading the module.
This information is very helpful when you must remote debug a load
failure from CPAN testing whose is running on a different platform.

\=item File-FileUtil-0.02

Added the method I<hex_dump>.

\=item File-FileUtil-0.03

\=over 4

\=item test_lib2inc

Returns to parent directory of
the first t directory going up
from the test script instead of the
t directory.

\=item find_t_roots

Added the function find_t_roots that
returns the parent directory of all
the directories in @INC

\=back

\=item File-AnySpec-0.01

Removed the methods for converting a
program module specification to its
absolute file from the
"File::FileUtil" module to their own module
"File::AnySpec" module.
The module name is now more descriptive
of the routines in the module.

Corrective Action: 
This module uses the "SelfLoader" module that loads functions from the __DATA__ section.
There is a one at the end of the __DATA__ section but not one at the end of the code.
Added a 1 at the end of the code section in hopes this will cure this error.

Very pleased the way the File::Package funcstions and the "Test" dual input ok function
remotely reported the error messages from loading the "File::AnySpec" module with a
require.

\=item File-AnySpec-0.03

\=item File-AnySpec-0.04

Change test so that test support program modules resides in distribution
directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory. 
Because they are no longer in the lib directory, 
test support files will not be installed as a pre-condition for the 
test of this module.
The test of this module will precede immediately.
The test support files in the tlib directory will vanish after
the installtion.

\=item File-AnySpec-0.05

Added subroutine interfaces.

Use Archive::TarGzip 0.02 that uses modd 777 for directories instead of 666. Started to get
emails from Unix about untar not being able to change to
a directory with mod of 666.

\=item File-AnySpec-0.06

Added the 'Data-Secs2' to the 'tlib' test library.
Upgraded to the 'Test-Tech' module that uses the 'Data-Secs2' module.

The lastest build of C<Test::STDmaker> expects the test library in the same
directory as the test script.
Coordiated with the lastest Test::STDmaker by moving the
test library from tlib to C<t/File>, the same directory as the test script
and deleting the test library File::TestPath program module.

Changed from the obsolete C<File::PM2File> program module to 
the C<File::Where> program module.

DOCUMENT_OVERVIEW:
This document releases ${NAME} version ${VERSION}
providing a description of the inventory, installation
instructions and other information necessary to
utilize and track this release.
^

CAPABILITIES:
The system is the Perl programming language software.
As established by the Perl referenced documents,
program modules, such the 
"L<File::AnySpec|File::AnySpec>" module, extend the Perl language.

The methods in the "L<File::AnySpec|File::AnySpec>" module
manipulate file specifications not only for the current
operating system but for foreign operating systems.
^

PROBLEMS:
There is still much work needed to ensure the quality 
of this module as follows:

\=over 4

\=item *

State the functional requirements for each method 
including not only the GO paths but also what to
expect for the NOGO paths

\=item *

All the tests are GO path tests. Should add
NOGO tests.

\=item *

Add the requirements addressed as I<# R: >
comment to the tests

\=item *

Write a program to build a matrix to trace
test step to the requirements and vice versa by
parsing the I<# R: > comments.
Automatically insert the matrix in the
module POD.
