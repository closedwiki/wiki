=head1 DESCRIPTION

In a perfect Perl, everything would behave exactly the same
running under C<eval>. 
Many times the reason to use an C<eval> is the anticipation
that the expression may die. 
When that happens, a perfect Perl would have deposited all the output
fromm the C<warn> and C<die> in C<$@>.
Maybe you have a perfect Perl. 
However, it is shocking that there are some Perls on some platforms out in the wild
that are mutants and are not perfect. 

A C<require> under eval works just fine just to see if a program
will load or not. If working locally, you can simply devise
a quick debug setup and track down the problem. 
However, when running tests remotely, on different remote 
platforms, running continuously unattended where uptime is important,
or any number of situations it is very helpful to have
meaningful error messages when a problem arise.

Thus, the reason to run under C<eval> is not only to avoid
the C<die> but also to pick up the error message
returned by C<eval> in C<$@>.
In certain situations it is extremely critical to obtain reliable error
messages when a failure occurs.

Well, a C<eval "require $program_module"> failure returns a reasonble
looking C<$@> except for one small thing.
Not all the warnings make it to C<$@> at least on one Perl,
probably more. 
And there can be quite a few warnings when loading a broken program module.
It would be nice if everyone could update to a Perl where the
C<eval> deposits all the warnings in C<$@>.
But as the acient proverb says, "If wishes were horses, beggers would ride.".

One workaround is to catch the warnings with C<$SIG{__WARN__}>
when running the C<require> under a C<eval>.
This collects all the warnings which is good. Now when a load fails, the
program does not die, it gracefully collects all the warnings and
logs them or ships back.

Now try the C<import> under C<eval> and pick up the error messages.
The C<import> and C<eval> is big time "failure to communicate" aka
the movie "Cool Hand Luke". 
The C<import> uses the caller stack to determine where to stuff the symbols
and there is a lot of C<Carp> C<croak> gyrations such as making C<import>
look like C<use>, trapping C<warnings> and C<dies>.
The C<eval> takes off on its own caller stack which
to quote President Bush: "is not helpful".

The C<import> uses the C<croak> instead of C<die> directly or
else any efforts to get meaningfull error messages
would be dead on arrival.
Perl is designed so that it is nearly impossible to avoid a
die unless running under a C<eval>. 
A workaround is hooking in a C<croak> that does not die and collecting
the error messages.

=head1 Subroutines

=head2 is_package_loaded

 $package = is_package_loaded($program_module, $package)

The C<is_package_loaded> subroutine determines if the C<$package>
is present and the C<$progarm_module> loaded. 
If C<$package> is absent, 0 or '', C<$package> is set to the 
C<program_module>.

=head2 load_package

  $error = load_package($program_module, @import, [@package_list]);

The C<load_package> subroutine attempts to capture any load problems by
loading the package with a "require " under an eval and capturing
all the "warn" and $@ messages. 

If the C<$program_module> load is successful, 
the checks that the packages in the @package list are present.
If @package list is absent, the C<$program_module> uses
the C<program_module> name as a list of one package.
Although a program module and package have the same name
syntax, they are entirely different.
A program module is a file. 
A package is a hash of symbols, a symbol table.
The Perl convention is that the names for each are the same
which enhances the appearance that they are the same
when in fact they are different.
Thus, a program module may have a single package
with a different name or many different packages.

Finally the C<$program_module> subroutine will import the symbols
in the C<@import> list.
If C<@import> is absent C<$program_module> subroutine does not
import any symbols; if C<@import> is '', all symbols are imported.
A C<@import> of 0 usually results in an C<$error>.

The C<$program_module> traps all load errors and all import
C<Carp::Crock> errors and returns them in the C<$error> string.

One very useful application of the C<load_package> subroutine is in test scripts. 
If a package does load, it is very helpful that the program does
not die and reports the reason the package did not load. 
This information is readily available when loaded at a local site.
However, it the load occurs at a remote site and the load crashes
Perl, the remote tester usually will not have this information
readily available. 

Other applications include using backup alternative software
if a package does not load. For example if the package
'Compress::Zlib' did not load, an attempt may be made
to use the gzip system command. 

=head1 BUGS

The C<load_package> cannot load program modules whose
name contain the '-' characters. 
The 'eval' function used to trap the die errors
believes it means subtraction.
