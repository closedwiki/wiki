# Configuration file for TWiki, held in 'lib' directory. You can edit
# this file directly to set your configuration, but in general it's better
# to leave this file untouched and create a new file called "LocalSite.cfg"
# That way, there is no risk of your local settings being overwritten when
# you upgrade.
#
# See 'setlib.cfg' in 'bin' directory to configure non-standard location
# for 'lib' directory or Perl modules.
#
# Notes:
# - Latest version at http://twiki.org/
# - Installation instructions in $dataDir/TWiki/TWikiDocumentation.txt
# - Optionally create a new plugin or customize DefaultPlugin.pm for
#   custom extensions of rendering rules.
# - Upgrading TWiki is easy as long as you only customize DefaultPlugin.pm.
# - See a list of variables that can be accessed from topics in
#   TWikiDocumentation.html
#
# If you are installing TWiki for the first time, and you are on a
# Unix or Linux platform and behind a firewall, the only section you
# should need to worry about below is "General path settings".
# Remember it is better to create LocalSite.cfg and write your
# settings there than to edit this file.
#
# If you are on a public site, you will need to consider carefully
# how you are going to manage authentication and access control.
#
# There are a number of documentation topics describing how to
# configure TWiki for different platforms, and a lot of support
# available at TWiki.org. The configuration settings currently in
# use can be reviewed using the 'testenv' script, as described in the
# documentation.

######## Operating system ############################################

# $cfg{DetailedOS} and $cfg{OS} are calculated in the TWiki code. You
# should only need to override if there is something badly wrong with
# those calculations.
# $cfg{DetailedOS} should be the value of Perl $OS
# $cfg{OS} may be one of UNIX WINDOWS VMS DOS MACINTOSH OS2

######## General path settings #######################################
# NOTE: If your server is running Microsoft Windows, paths should
# normally be written as "c:/foo" not "c:\foo" (which doesn't do what
# you may think it does).
#
# If LocalSite.cfg is used, the following paths _must_ be set
# there and _not_ here.

# URL for TWiki host e.g. http://myhost.com:123
# $cfg{DefaultUrlHost} = 'http://your.domain.com';

# cgi-bin URL path for TWiki e.g. /twiki/bin
# $cfg{ScriptUrlPath} = '/twiki/bin';

# Attachments URL path e.g. /twiki/pub
# $cfg{PubUrlPath} = '/twiki/pub';

# Attachments store file path (not URL), must match /twiki/pub e.g.
# /usr/local/twiki/pub
# $cfg{PubDir} = '/home/httpd/twiki/pub';

# Template directory e.g. /usr/local/twiki/templates
# $cfg{TemplateDir} = '/home/httpd/twiki/templates';

# Topic files store (file path not URL) e.g. /usr/local/twiki/data
# $cfg{DataDir} = '/home/httpd/twiki/data';

# URL path to scripts used to render links. Defaults to $cfg{ScriptUrlPath}.
# May need to be set if using redirection to shorten URLs.

######## Security setup ##############################################

# Path control. If set, overrides the default PATH setting to control

# settings below, rather than relying on this path.
#
# ---+ Unix or Linux
#    * path separator is :
#    * ensure diff and shell (Bourne or bash type) is found on 
#      the path (control the path with safeEnvPath).
# ---+ Windows ActiveState Perl, with non-Cygwin RCS, OR no
#      PERL5SHELL setting.
#    * path separator is ;
#    * The Windows system directory (e.g. c:winntsystem32) is
#      required in this path.
#    * Must NOT use '/' in pathnames as this upsets cmd.exe -
#      single '' is OK using Perl single-quoted string.
# ---+ Windows: ActiveState Perl, with Cygwin RCS and PERL5SHELL set
#      to 'c:/cygwin/bin/bash.exe -c'
#    * path separator is ;
#    * best to avoid 'c:/foo' type paths, because it can cause a
#      Perl 'Insecure directory in $ENV{PATH}' error.
#      The best approach is to convert 'c:/foo' to '/c/cygdrive/foo'
#      - odd looking but it works!  The Windows system directory 
#      (e.g. /cygdrive/c/winnt/system32) is required in this path.
#      For example:
#      /cygdrive/c/YOURCYGWINDIR/bin;/cygdrive/c/YOURWINDOWSDIR/system32
# ---+ Windows: ActiveState Perl, with non-Cygwin RCS,
#       OR no PERL5SHELL setting.
#    * path separator is ';'
#    * The Windows system directory is required in this path.
#       Must NOT use / in directories on the path as this upsets

# languages.  Ignored if 0 is 0.
#
# Locale names are not standardised - check 'locale -a' on your
# system to see what's installed, and check this works using command
# line tools.  You may also need to check what charsets your browsers
# accept - the 'preferred MIME names' at
# http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets are a good starting
# point.
#
# WARNING: Topics are stored in site character set format, so data
# conversion of file names and contents will be needed if you change
# locales after creating topics whose names or contents include 8-bit
# characters.
#

# 'de_AT.ISO-8859-15';	# Austria with ISO-8859-15 for Euro

# should contain upper case non-ASCII letters.  This is termed
# 'non-locale regexes' mode.
#
# If 'non-locale regexes' is in effect, WikiWord linking will work,
