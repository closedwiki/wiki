# Configuration file for TWiki, held in 'lib' directory. You can edit
# this file directly to set your configuration, but it's much MUCH better
# to leave this file untouched and create a new file called "LocalSite.cfg"
# That way, there is no risk of your local settings being overwritten when
# you upgrade.
#
# See 'setlib.cfg' in 'bin' directory to configure non-standard location
# for 'lib' directory or Perl modules.
#
# Note that the comments in this file are formatted specifically so
# that the 'configure' script can extract documentation from here.

# the settings are required; these are marked with a
# <font color="red">*</font>. Fill in the settings, and then select 'Update'.

# Unix or Linux platform and behind a firewall, the only section you
# should need to worry about below is "General path settings".

# If you are on a public site, you will need to consider carefully
# how you are going to manage authentication and access control.
# <p />
# There are a number of documentation topics describing how to
# configure TWiki for different platforms, and a lot of support
# available at TWiki.org. The configuration settings currently in
# use can be managed using the 'configure' script.

# <a href="$TWiki::cfg{ScriptUrlPath}/view$TWiki::cfg{ScriptSuffix}">right here</a>

# Pick up values for use within expressions in this file. It is important
# not to refer to $cfg{...} in values in this file (or LocalSite.cfg)

#   the browser, so requires client sessions to work.

# </li><li>
