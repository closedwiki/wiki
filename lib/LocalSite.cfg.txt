# Example site-specific configuration file for TWiki, held in 'lib' directory. 
#
# This is distributed as LocalSite.cfg.txt - copy this file to LocalSite.cfg
# And edit your LocalSite.cfg  instead of changing TWiki.cfg.
#
# This file overrides TWiki.cfg so there is no risk of your settings 
# being overwritten when you upgrade.
#
# Only the most commonly used settings are listed in LocalSite.cfg.txt
# See TWiki.cfg to copy across the other (seldom changed) settings 
#
# See 'setlib.cfg' in 'bin' directory to configure non-standard location
# for 'lib' directory or Perl modules.

######## General path settings #######################################
# NOTE: If your server is running Microsoft Windows, paths should
# normally be written as "c:/foo" not "c:\foo" (which doesn't do what
# you may think it does). You can use '\' without problems inside
# single quotes, e.g. 'c:\foo'.

# URL for TWiki host e.g. http://myhost.com:123
$cfg{DefaultUrlHost} = 'http://your.domain.com';

# cgi-bin URL path for TWiki e.g. /twiki/bin
$cfg{ScriptUrlPath} = '/twiki/bin';

# Attachments URL path e.g. /twiki/pub
$cfg{PubUrlPath} = '/twiki/pub';

# Attachments store file path (not URL), must match /twiki/pub e.g.
# /usr/local/twiki/pub
$cfg{PubDir} = '/home/httpd/twiki/pub';

# Template directory e.g. /usr/local/twiki/templates
$cfg{TemplateDir} = '/home/httpd/twiki/templates';

# Topic files store (file path not URL) e.g. /usr/local/twiki/data
$cfg{DataDir} = '/home/httpd/twiki/data';

# Directory must be writable by the CGI user (Note: this variable is
# local to this file; it is not used in the code).
# ## THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER - See Codev.LogDirectory for my Q as to its removal.
my $logDir = $cfg{DataDir};

# URL path to scripts used to render links. Defaults to the same as
# $cfg{ScriptUrlPath}. Set if using redirection to shorten URLs.
$cfg{DispScriptUrlPath} = undef;

# Suffix of TWiki Perl scripts (e.g. .pl)
$cfg{ScriptSuffix} = '';

######## Security setup ##############################################

# Added to email addresses to Prevent spambots from grabbing
# addresses e.g. set to 'NOSPAM' to get user.com
# rendered as user.com. Usually only required
# for public websites.

# Default store implementation
# RcsWrap - use RCS executables
# RcsLite - use a 100% Perl simplified implementation of Perl
# RcsLite is useful if you don't have, and can't install, RCS - for
# example, on a hosted platform. It will work, and is compatible with
# RCS, but is not quite as fast.
$cfg{StoreImpl} = 'RcsWrap';
