# Example site-specific configuration file for TWiki, held in 'lib' directory. 
#
# This is distributed as LocalSite.cfg.txt - if for some reason you can't,
# or don't want to, use =configure= to manage your site configuration, you can
# copy this file to LocalSite.cfg edit it manually.
#
# LocalSite.cfg overrides TWiki.cfg, so there is no risk of your settings 
# being overwritten when you upgrade.
#
# Only the most commonly used settings are listed in LocalSite.cfg.txt
# See TWiki.cfg to copy across the other (seldom changed) settings 
#
# Use 'LocalLib.cfg' in the 'bin' directory to configure non-standard
# locations for the 'lib' directory or Perl modules.
#

# NOTE: If your server is running Microsoft Windows, paths should
# normally be written as "c:/foo" not "c:\foo" (which doesn't do what
# you may think it does). You can use '\' without problems inside
# single quotes, e.g. 'c:\foo'.

# If LocalSite.cfg is used (and it _should_ be), then _all_ the
# following paths muct be defined.

# URL for TWiki host e.g. http://myhost.com:123
$cfg{DefaultUrlHost} = 'http://your.domain.com';

# cgi-bin URL path for TWiki e.g. /twiki/bin
$cfg{ScriptUrlPath} = '/twiki/bin';

# Attachments URL path e.g. /twiki/pub
$cfg{PubUrlPath} = '/twiki/pub';

# Attachments store file path (not URL), must match /twiki/pub e.g.
# /usr/local/twiki/pub
$cfg{PubDir} = '/home/httpd/twiki/pub';

# SECURITY NOTE: Directories =twiki/data= , =twiki/templates= and all their
# subdirectories should be set so that they are _not_ visible through
# URLs. (Alternatively, move the directories to a place where they are
# not visible, and set the paths here as appropriate)

# Template directory e.g. /usr/local/twiki/templates
$cfg{TemplateDir} = '/home/httpd/twiki/templates';

# Topic files store (file path not URL) e.g. /usr/local/twiki/data
# TWiki will use this path to base other defaults, such as the location
# of password files.
$cfg{DataDir} = '/home/httpd/twiki/data';

# TWiki.cfg will use this path to default where to put log files, unless
# you override individual paths here.
$cfg{LogDir} = $cfg{DataDir};
