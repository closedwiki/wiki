---+ package TWiki::OopsException

Exception used to raise a request to redirect to an Oops URL.
An OopsException thrown anywhere in the code will redirect the
browser to a url based on the =oops= script. =oops= requires a
=template= parameter, that is the name of a template file from
the =templates= directory. This file will be expanded and the
parameter values passed to the exception instantiated. The
result will be shown in the browser.

---++ ClassMethod new( $template, ...)
   * =template= is the name of an oops template
The remaining parameters are interpreted as key-value pairs. The following keys are used:
   * =web= will be used as the web for the oops
   * =topic= will be used as the topic for the oops
   * =def= - is the (optional) name of a TMPL:DEF within the template
   * =keep= - if set, the exception handler should try it's damndest to retain parameter values from the query.
   * =params= is a reference to an array of parameters. These will be substituted for !%PARAM1%, !%PARAM2% ... !%PARAMn% in the template.
