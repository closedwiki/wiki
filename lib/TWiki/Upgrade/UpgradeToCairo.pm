Here's what's about to happen:

1) I'm going to create a new TWiki in $targetDir based on this new distribution
2) I'm going to update the config files to match the existing TWiki config
3) I'm going to merge the new TWiki data files from the release with all your existing information

Now: you need to 

 - Check the files listed above (if any) who's patches were rejected.

   For these files, you'll want to check the .rej file (in the same directory as the file)
   and see whether there are changes in there that you need to make manually.

 - Check the files list above that have 'no common versions' - in those cases, your
   new install will still work, but you need to be aware the topic file that is in 
   place is your old one... no changes from the new release have been included.

 - Check if you modified your old version of setlib.cfg: if you did,
    then you need to do the same to the new one (which you will find in ./bin).

   (There are only two reasons I can think of why you might have done that:
     1) You wanted to workaround the Apache2 hang bug or 
     2) You needed to point to a local perl library for some reason.  )

 - Setup authentication for the new TWiki

    If you are using htaccess, then check the diffs above make sense.
    If you are using some other method, you'll need to figure out what you need to do (sorry!)

 - Set the permissions appropriately for the new TWiki.

   I have given pub and data global read and write access, so your new TWiki
   will work, but you might want tighter controls.

 - If you are one of the few people who modified \@storeSettings, then you need to 
   look in TWiki.cfg and see if you need to make changes (I installed new the default ones)

   If you don't know what this means, it probably doesn't apply to you.

 - Re-install plugins you were using

 - Copy over custom templates you put in the original templates directory

 - anything else I haven't thought of

 - Archive your old installation 

 - Move the newly created twiki directory ($targetDir) to the place where your previous version was.

 - Rearrange sub-directories the way you like them, if needed.
   (some sites have bin in a very different place to the rest, for example)

 - Use your browser to check the whole thing: visit the 'testenv' script, which I am guessing is at:

      $TWikiCfg::defaultUrlHost$TWikiCfg::scriptUrlPath/testenv$TWikiCfg::scriptSuffix

   make sure there are no unwarranted warnings, 

   and finally: visit TWikiPreferences, which I'm guessing is at:

      $TWikiCfg::defaultUrlHost$TWikiCfg::scriptUrlPath/view$TWikiCfg::scriptSuffix/TWiki/TWikiPreferences

   ... it should be working, and you can edit the new WIKIWEBMASTER setting!

Goodluck... :-)
