%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

---++ Introduction

In some TWiki applications there is a need to send e-mails as part of the workflow. This plugin is a flexible solution to send e-mails when certain actions occure, such as when submitting a form or when creating a topic. The Sandbox.SendMailPluginDemo has a working example showing how to send an e-mail when a user submits a form to vote on his/her favorite city.

The related TWiki:Plugins.SendEmailPlugin is a web form mailer, used for things like "contact us" web forms.

---++ Syntax Rules

=%<nop>SENDMAIL{ action="send" ... }%=

%INCLUDE{VarSENDMAIL}%

#OpenMailRelay
---++ Security Note on Open Mail Relay

Public TWiki sites can potentially be abused as an open mail relay if this plugin is installed and enabled. The plugin can be secured as follows on public sites:

   * Set the ={Plugins}{SendMailPlugin}{From}= configure setting to a token such as =$webmasteremail=, or to a fixed addess.
   * Set the ={Plugins}{SendMailPlugin}{To}= configure setting to a token such as =$useremail=, or to a fixed addess.
   * Set the ={Plugins}{SendMailPlugin}{CC}= configure setting to =disable= (to disable), a token such as =$useremail=, or to a fixed addess.
   * Set the ={Plugins}{SendMailPlugin}{BCC}= configure setting to =disable=, a token, or to a fixed addess.

Setting these configure settings will disable the four corresponding =%<nop>SENDMAIL{"..."}%= parameters. That is, TWiki cannot be abused as an open mail relay.
