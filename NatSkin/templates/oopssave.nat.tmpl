You cannot call this script directly, <nop>%WIKITOOLNAME% uses it internally.

Some browser configurations occasionally send undefined data to the
server. Don't worry, your changes are not lost. Just click the Back 
button on your browser and then try Save again.

The other possibility is an internal error in <nop>%WIKITOOLNAME% 
configuration, or that you did not have write access to the 
directory or file that was being edited.
