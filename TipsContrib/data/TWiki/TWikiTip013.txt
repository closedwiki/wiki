---+ Preference settings

TWiki has four levels of preferences settings:
	1 Site-level settings: %WIKIPREFSTOPIC%
		* Site name, proxy settings, access control, skin
	1 Web-level settings: located in each Web, e.g. %WEBPREFSTOPIC%
		* Web specific access control, navigation links, colors
	1 User-level settings: In each user's home page, e.g. %WIKIUSERNAME% 
		* Settings that are only in effect when this user is logged in. Note that the EDITBOXWIDTH and EDITBOXHEIGHT settings that you find in the user topics do not have any effect in the default !PatternSkin which stores these settings in a cookie.
	1 Topic-level settings: Affecting current topic, for web applications

Preferences can be overridden by the next level down.
