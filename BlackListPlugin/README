NOTE:

This Plugin is removed from the TWikiRelease04x00 branch.
Please get the latest Plugin version from the DEVELOP branch.

Reason for single branch development:
   * Reduce confusion where to develop (some use DEVELOP, 
     some use TWikiRelease04x00, some use Plugins web.)
   * Avoid a developer centric "one Plugin for each release" 
     view, with "click here to download for Cairo, here for
     Dakar" message for users. 
   * Reduce the likelihood of divergence and Plugins API 
     changes, e.g. avoid incompatibility issues that hurt
     the TWiki project.
