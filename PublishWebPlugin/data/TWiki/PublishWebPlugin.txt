Utility to publish a TWiki web to static HTML pages. Useful to maintain a static website collaboratively in an access restricted TWiki.

---++ Description and Syntax Rules

One web (defined in the PUBLISHWEBNAME setting) serves as the master for the static HTML pages. The Plugin generates an HTML page every time a user saves a topic in the Publish web. The static HTML files are based on a TWiki skin of choice. All referred attachments (images etc) are copied to a publish directory.

---+++ Topics and Links

   * The home topic is assumed to be =Index=
   * Topic names: For clarity, use capitalized words and underscores (%SYSTEMWEB%.WikiWord names are possible too)
   * All links should be defined as double square bracket links, e.g. =[<nop>[Topic]]= or =[<nop>[Topic][label]]= (do not use %SYSTEMWEB%.WikiWord links)

#PublishProcess
---+++ Publish process

   * A static HTML page is generated for every topic saved in the %PUBLISHWEBNAME% web (unless listed in the EXCLUDETOPIC setting)
   * Topic names get converted to a lowercase filename, e.g. =Index= to =index.html=, =AboutUs= to =aboutus.html=, and =Customer_Support= to =customer_support.html=
   * Only text between =%<nop>STARTPUBLISH%= and =%<nop>STOPPUBLISH%= is used (the whole text if missing)
   * !WikiWord links are ignored, also across webs
   * Page layout is based on the skin defined in the PUBLISHSKIN setting
   * Visit %PUBLISHWEBNAME%.WebPublish to re-publish topics without an edit/save cycle

---+++ Variables

   * =%<nop>STARTPUBLISH%= - place in topic text where to start publishing
      * Optional, start from top if missing
   * =%<nop>STOPPUBLISH%= - place in topic text where to stop publishing
      * Optional, publish to end of topic if missing
   * =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"nicetopic"}%= - nice topic name
      * Shows a "nice" topic name of the current topic: Underscores in topic names are rendered as space; the Index topic is rendered with the HOMELABEL Plugin setting
      * Example: Topic =Customer_Support= turns into =Customer Support=
   * =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"breadcrumb"}%= - nice breadcrumb
      * The breadcrumb is based on the parent child relationship of topics, starting at the Index topic
      * The breadcrumb does _not_ include the current topic, append =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"nicetopic"}%= to get the complete breadcrumb
      * The skin may contain a =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"breadcrumb"}%= variable to show the breadcrumb
      * Underscores in topic names are rendered as space
      * Example: =You are here: <u>Home</u> &gt; <u>Customer Support</u> &gt;=
   * =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"publish" topic="Name"}%= - re-publish topic(s) without edit/save cycle
      * Useful to refresh all HTML pages if the skin has been modified
      * A =topic="all"= publishes all topics in the Publish web except for the excluded ones
      * A =topic="Any_Topic"= publishes a specific topics

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>PUBLISHWEBPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==. Do not change settings here, but add settings in the publish web's !WebPreferences, such as =* Set PUBLISHSKIN = mypublish=

   * One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Maintain a static website collaboratively in a TWiki web

   * Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
      * Set DEBUG = 0

   * Web to publish:
      * Set PUBLISHWEBNAME = Website

   * Skin to use to publish:
      * Set PUBLISHSKIN = website
      * __Note:__ It is also possible to specify a publish skin on a per page basis. Define a [[%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiForms][TWiki Form]] with a form field called !PublishSkin. It can be of any type, but a select dropdown box is probably most convenient.

   * Exclude topics from publishing:
      * Set EXCLUDETOPIC = WebPublish, WebAtom, WebChanges, WebCreateNewTopic, WebHome, WebIndex, WebLeftBar, WebNotify, WebPreferences, WebRss, WebSearchAdvanced, WebSearch, WebStatistics, WebTopicList, WebTopMenu, WebTopicCreator, WebTopicEditTemplate

   * Home label, used in =%<nop>PUBLISHBREADCRUMB%=:
      * Set HOMELABEL = Home

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions

__Note:__ You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this plugin. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the plugin on the TWiki server. 

   * Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below)
   * Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:
     | *File:* | *Description:* |
     | ==data/TWiki/%TOPIC%.txt== | Plugin topic |
     | ==data/Website/WebPublish.txt== | Publish page topic |
     | ==lib/TWiki/Plugins/%TOPIC%.pm== | Plugin Perl module |
     | ==templates/view.website.tmpl== | Demo publish skin |
   * Configure and test the installated Plugin:
      * Run the [[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%][configure]] script to enable the Plugin
      * Configuration on shell level:
         * Add/customize these =twiki/lib/LocalSite.cfg= settings: %BR%
            * =$TWiki::cfg{Plugins}{PublishWebPlugin}{TemplatePath}=: Template path where skin files are located.
               * If empty or omitted: the =twiki/templates= directory is assumed; normal %SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiTemplates search path applies, e.g. for a =PUBLISHSKIN = website= setting, a =twiki/templates/view.website.tmpl= template file is assumed
               * If specified: Must be an absolute path; skin is assumed to be an html page at that location, e.g. for a =PUBLISHSKIN = website= setting, a =$TWiki::cfg{Plugins}{PublishWebPlugin}{TemplatePath}/website.html= file is referenced
            * =$TWiki::cfg{Plugins}{PublishWebPlugin}{PublishPath}=: Path where the plugin places the generated html files.
               * Specify an absolute or relative path to the Apache htdocs root
               * If relative, path is relative to =twiki/pub=, such as ='..'=
            * =$TWiki::cfg{Plugins}{PublishWebPlugin}{AttachPath}=: Path where the plugin places images and other topic attachments.
               * Must be relative to =$TWiki::cfg{Plugins}{PublishWebPlugin}{PublishPath}=, default is ='_publish'=
            * Example:%BR%
              =$TWiki::cfg{Plugins}{PublishWebPlugin}{TemplatePath} = '';= %BR%
              =$TWiki::cfg{Plugins}{PublishWebPlugin}{PublishPath} = '/path/to/apache/httpdocs';= %BR%
              =$TWiki::cfg{Plugins}{PublishWebPlugin}{AttachPath} = '_publish';=
         * Create the directory indicated in the ={PublishPath}= setting if needed
         * Create the directory indicated in the ={AttachPath}= setting (relative to ={PublishPath}=)
         * Change the permission of directories indicated by ={PublishPath}= and ={AttachPath}= to be writable by the cgi user (such as user =nobody= on !RedHat Linux)
      * Create a new TWiki web for website publishing:
         * Create a new =Website= web (name indicated by the =PUBLISHWEBNAME= Plugin setting)
         * In !WebPreferences of that web, set the =NOAUTOLINK= setting to =on=
         * For convenience, add these links to the WebLeftBar:
            * =*Publishing*=
            * =[<nop>[Index][Home page topic]]=
            * =[<nop>[http://%<nop>HTTP_HOST%/index.html][/index.html]]=
            * =[<nop>[http://%<nop>HTTP_HOST%%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{topicurl}%][%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{topicurl}%]]=
            * =[<nop>[%<nop>SCRIPTURL{view}%/%<nop>WEB%/WebPublish?action=publish;ptopic=%<nop>BASETOPIC%][Re-publish this topic]]=
            * =[<nop>[%<nop>SYSTEMWEB%.PublishWebPlugin][PublishWebPlugin]]=
         * Create a =Sandbox_page= topic in that web
         * This should generate a =sandbox_page.html= page on topic save
         * Create =Index= topic and other topics
   * Publish skin:
      * Create a new publish skin that matches the look of your website. The [[%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiSkins][TWiki skin]] can be derived from any =twiki/templates/view.*.tmpl= skin file, or can be created from scratch. This plugin contains a bare bone demo skin called =website= located at =twiki/templates/view/website.tmpl=
      * Omit any links to TWiki, such as edit and attach links
      * The skin can use Plugin specific settings =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"breadcrumb"}%= and =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"nicetopic"}%=
      * The skin can introduce skin specific !WebPreferences settings, such as =%<nop>PUBLISH_SITE%=, =%<nop>PUBLISH_LOGO%=, etc.
      * Activate the new skin with a !WebPreferences settings, such as =* Set PUBLISHWEBPLUGIN_PUBLISHSKIN = mypublish=
      * You can have multiple publish skins; see note in the PUBLISHSKIN plugin setting above.

---++ Limitations

   * All attachments are copied into the same directory, e.g. make sure you use unique filenames across all topics in your publish web and in your skin
