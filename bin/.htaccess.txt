# bin/.htaccess.txt
#
# Controls access to TWiki scripts - to make Apache use it, rename this
# file to '.htaccess' and REPLACE THE FOLLOWING STRINGS WITH PATHS
# SPECIFIC TO YOUR INSTALLATION:
#
# !FILE_path_to_TWiki!
#    This is the absolute path to the directory where
#    you installed TWiki (where you unzipped the installation). The first
#    part should match the $dataDir setting in TWiki.cfg
# !URL_path_to_TWiki!
#    This is the URL path you put into the webserver for users to use to
#    access TWiki.
# !ADMIN_users!
#    Space-separated list of the login name(s) of the person(s) allowed
#    to run the configure script

# Use CGI & Perl to handle all files in 'bin' directory, i.e. run as scripts
# - this should remove the need to rename files to end in '.pl' etc,
# if your web hosting provider permits this.  Remove if using mod_perl.
SetHandler cgi-script

# Password file for TWiki users

# Authentication type (htpasswd file) (comment out this if you configure htpasswd / LDAP support)

#for LDAP password support uncomment the following (and fix up the paths)

# match the $scriptUrlPath in TWiki.cfg
