# -------------- Only needed to work around an Apache 2.0 bug on Unix
#
#    If you are running TWiki on Apache 2.0 on Unix you might experience
#    TWiki scripts hanging forever. This is a known Apache 2.0 bug. A fix is 
#    available at http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22030.
#    It is recommended to patch your Apache installation.
#
#    As a workaround, add one of the following two lines to LocalSite.cfg
#    (without the leading #). As a drawback, errors will not be reported
#    to the browser via CGI::Carp any more)

# open(STDERR, ">>/dev/null");      # throw away cgi script errors, or
# open(STDERR, ">>/tmp/error.log"); # redirect errors to a log file of choice

# -------------- Path to lib directory containing TWiki.pm. 
#
# The path should be set to an absolute path for maximum efficiency.
# If you leave it as a relative path it'll still work, but will use
# Cwd::abs_path() which may be slower.
# Add the following line to LocalLib.cfg (without the leading #)

# $twikiLibPath = "/absolute/path/to/your/lib";

# -------------- Extra path components to include in @INC
#
# If you need to use perl modules that are not installed in the standard
# directories (e.g. you have downloaded extra modules for use with plugins)
# then you can add the absolute paths to those modules by adding the following
# line to LocalLib.cfg (without the leading #). You can list as many
# directories as you want, separated by commas.

# @localPerlLibPath = ( 'path_to_dir' );

# http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/04/10/mod_perl.html?page=3 has good advice
# on installing CPAN modules without superuser privileges.
