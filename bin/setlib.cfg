# setlib.cfg: configuration file for TWiki and Perl library paths
#
# Used to configure non-standard locations for TWiki and Perl modules.


# -------------- Only needed to work around an Apache 2.0 bug on Unix
#
#    If you are running TWiki on Apache 2.0 on Unix you might experience cgi
#    scripts to hang forever. This is a known Apache 2.0 bug. A fix is 
#    available at http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22030.
#    It is recommended to patch your Apache installation.
#
#    As a workaround, uncomment one of the following two lines. (As a drawback,
#    errors will not be reported anymore to the browser via CGI::Carp)

# open(STDERR, ">>/dev/null");         # throw away cgi script errors, or
# open(STDERR, ">>/tmp/error.log");    # redirect errors to a log file of choice


# -------------- Change these settings if required
#    Path to lib directory containing TWiki.pm. 
#    Set this to a hardcoded, *absolute file path* if you are concerned about 
#    the performance implications of using Cwd::abs_path()
$twikiLibPath = "/home/twiki/DEVELOP/lib";

# THIS SECTION IS COMMENTED OUT BY THE pod
#    Path to local Perl modules
