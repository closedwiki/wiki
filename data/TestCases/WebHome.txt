This is the <nop>%WEB% web. If you are here, you want to test this version of TWiki. This web is held in the TWiki Subversion repository, so:
	1 You must manually ensure that all topics in this web are readable and writable by the apache user
	1 You must _not_ check in ,v files. Topic histories will be maintained in Subversion.
	1 New files in this web must be manually added to the Subversion repository.

The <nop>%WEB% web is stripped down; it only contains this topic, and topics containing tests and test fixtures.

The testcases are an important assistant to TWiki testing. However they should _not_ be regarded as the only required testing; manual testing, by a user interacting with TWiki, is also key.

Each testcase consists of a single topic, always named <nop>TestCase<i>Something</i> where _Something_ is descriptive of the testcase. Testcases should contain a line starting with "Description: " that describes what the testcase does, for the table below. Other topics may be created to provide test fixtures, but all topics should be regarded as read-only i.e. no test should require the overwriting of any of the topics in this web. If you need to create topics in order to execute a test, please do so, but delete them after you are finished to avoid any risk of polluting future tests.

Testcases that test TWiki rendering may include markers that indicate to the %TWIKIWEB%.TestFixturePlugin what is _expected_ versus what TWiki _actually_ produces. See %TWIKIWEB%.TestFixturePlugin for details.

The automatic tests may be run on a topic by clicking on the "run" link for the testcase in the table below. The testcases are run with _no plugins enabled_. The tests are also run as part of the daily smoke tests, the results of which can be seen at http://ntwiki.ethermage.net/users/develop/pub/TestOutput/runtest.html.

_Note that only those testcases with names that start with =<nop>TestCaseAuto= are fully automated_.
