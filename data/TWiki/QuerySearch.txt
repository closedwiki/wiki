---# Query Search

Query searches help you search the contents of forms attached to your topics, as well as the values of other meta-data attached to the topic. Using query searches you can search:
   1 The fields of forms
   1 Parent relationships
   1 File attachment information (but *not* the attached files themselves)

Query searches are defined using a simple SQL-like query language. The language consists of _field specifiers_ and _constants_ joined with _operators_.

---++ Field specifiers
You use field specifiers to say what value from the topic you are interested
in.

All meta-data in a topic is referenced according to a to a simple plan.
 
   * =attachments= (FILEATTACHMENT)
      * _for each attachment_
         * =name=
         * =attr=
         * =comment=
         * =path=
         * =size=
         * =user=
         * =rev=
         * =date=
         * =comment=
   * =parent= (TOPICPARENT)
      * =name=
   * =info= (TOPICINFO)
      * =author=
      * =date=
      * =format=
      * =version=
   * =moved= (TOPICMOVED)
      * =by=
      * =date=
      * =from=
      * =to=
   * =form= (FORM) - the name of the main form of the topic
      * =name= (known as the _formname_)
   * =fields= (FIELD) - the fields in the form. You can also use the name of the form (the value of =form.name= e.g. =PersonForm=)
      * _for each field in the form_
         * =name=
         * =title=
         * =value=

See TWikiMetaData for details of what all these fields mean. =attachments= and =fields= are both _arrays_, which means they can have any number of records under them.

This plan is referenced using a simple syntax:
| =X= | will get the field named =X=. For example, =info=, =moved= or =attachments=. |
| =X.Y= | will get the subfield =Y= of the field named =X=. For example =info.date=, =moved.by=, =parent.name= |
| =X[N]= | will get the Nth element of an array. N starts at 0. For example, =attachments[4]= will get the fifth attachment in the list. |
| =X[WHERE <i>query</i>]= | will get all the elements of the array =X= that match _query_ - for example, =attachments[WHERE size>1024]=. _query_ can be as complex as you like; for example, =DocumentForm[WHERE name!='Summary' AND value~'top secret'].value=. =[?= is a synonym for =[WHERE=. |
| =X:Y= | will get the value of the field specified by =Y= from the topic specified by the _value_ of =X=. =X= must evaluate to a topic name, and =Y= to a query to be applied to that topic. For example, =parent.name:form.name='ExampleForm'= will evaluate to true if (1) the topic has a parent, (2) the parent topic has the main form type =ExampleForm=. |

Note: at some point TWiki may support multiple forms in the same topic. For this reason you are recommended *not* to use the =fields= keyword when accessing form fields, but always use the name of the form.

There is a shortcut for accessing form fields. The syntax =X= will evaluate to =<i>field</i>[WHERE name=X].value=, if and only if =X= doesn't match another field name. For example, the following expressions will all evaluate to the same value(s)
   * =fields[WHERE name='Lastname'].value=
   * =PersonForm[WHERE name='Lastname'].value=
   * =Lastname=
   * =PersonForm.Lastname=
If =X= would conflict with the name of a top level field in the topic, you can prepend the name of the form to protect it. 

---++ Constants
You use constants for the values that you compare with fields. Constants are either strings, or numbers. Strings are always delimited by single-quotes (you can escape a quote using backslash). Numbers can be any integer or floating point number. 

---++ Operators

Field specifiers and constants are combined using _operators_ to create queries.
| *Operator* | *Meaning* |
| <code>=</code> | Left-hand side (LHS) exactly matches the value on the Right-hand side (RHS). Numbers and strings can be compared. |
| <code>!=</code> | Inverse of <code>=</code>. |
| =~= | wildcard match ('*' will match any number of characters, '?' will match any single character e.g. "PersonForm.Surname ~ '*Smit?'") |
| <code>&lt;</code> | LHS is less that RHS. If both sides are numbers, the order is numeric. Otherwise it is alphabetic (applies to all comparison operators) |
| <code>&gt;</code> | &gt; |
| <code>&gt;=</code> | &gte; |
| <code>&lt;=</code> | &lte; |
| =lc(x)= | Converts x to lower case, Use for caseless comparisons. |
| =uc(x)= | Converts x to UPPER CASE. Use for caseless comparisons. |
| =d2n(x)= | Converts a date (expressed in [[TimeSpecifications][one of the formats that TWiki can parse]]) to a number of seconds since 1st Jan 1970. This is the format dates are stored in inside TWiki, and you have to convert a string date using =d2n= before you can compare it with - for example - the date an attachment was uploaded. Times without a timezone are assumed to be in server local time. If you have date fields in your forms, note that they are *not* stored in TWiki's internal format, but are stored as text strings. You should still use =d2n= to convert them to numbers for comparisons, though. |
| =NOT= | Invert the result of the subquery |
| =AND= | Combine two subqueries |
| =OR= | Combine two subqueries |
| =()= | Bracketed subquery |

%I% The same operators are supported for [[VarIF][%IF statements]].

---++ Putting it all together
When a query is applied to a topic, the goal is to reduce to a TRUE or FALSE value that indicates whether the topic matches that query or not. If the query returns TRUE, then the topic is included in the search results.

A query matches if the query returns one or more values when it is applied to the topic. So if I have a very simple query, such as ="attachments"=, then this will return TRUE for all topics that have one or more attachments. If I write ="attachments[WHERE size>1024 AND name ~ '*.gif']"= then it will return TRUE for all topics that have at least one attachment larger than 1024 bytes with a name ending in =.gif=.

---++ Examples

---+++ Query examples
   * =attachments[WHERE name='purdey.gif']= - true if there is an attachment call =purdey.gif= on the topic
   * =(fields[WHERE name='Firstname'].value='Emma' OR fields[name=Firstname].value='John') AND fields[name='Lastname'].value='Peel'= - true for 'Emma Peel' and 'John Peel' but *not* 'Robert Peel' or 'Emma Thompson'
   * =(Firstname='Emma' OR Firstname='John') AND Lastname='Peel'= - shortcut form of the previous query
   * =History<nop>Form[WHERE name='Age'].value>2= - true if the topic has a =HistoryForm=, and the form has a field called =Age= with a value > 2
   * =History<nop>Form.Age > 2= - shortcut for the previous query
   * =Person:ClothesForm[WHERE name='Headgear'].value ~ '*Bowler Hat*'= - true if the form attached to the topic has a field called =Person= that has a value that is the name of a topic, and that topic contains the form =ClothesForm=, with a field called =Headgear=, which has a value that contains the string ='Bowler Hat'=. (Phew!)

---++ Grammar of the query language
<verbatim>
query ::= aexpr [ 'OR' expr ] ;
aexpr ::= nexpr [ 'AND' aexpr ] ;
nexpr ::= 'NOT' nexpr | bexpr ;
bexpr ::= uexpr [ bop bexpr ] ;
bop :: = '>' | '<' | '<=' | '>=' | '!=' | '~' | '=' ;
uexpr ::= uop ref | ref ;
uop ::= 'lc' | 'uc' | 'd2n' ;
ref ::= specifier [ ':' ref ] ;
specifier ::= terminal '.' specifier | terminal '[' [ '?' ] query ']';
terminal ::= '(' query ')' | string | name ;
name ::= a string of alphanumberic characters and underscores ;
string ::= any string of characters in single quotes
