---+ =IF= Statements

The =%<nop>IF%= construct gives TWiki the power to include content in topics based on the value of simple expressions.

=%<nop>IF{"CONDITION" then="THEN" else="ELSE"}%=

In the example above, if CONDITION evaluates to TRUE, then THEN will be included in the topic; otherwise ELSE will be included.

Note that because of the way TWiki evaluates, then whatever is in the THEN and ELSE parameters will already have been expanded by the time the condition is actually evaluated. The standard FormatTokens can be used in the THEN and ELSE parameters when you need to delay evaluation of (for example) a TWiki variable.

The basic syntax of a condition is as follows:
<verbatim>
expr ::= '(' expr ')' ;
expr ::= andexpr | andexpr 'or' expr ;
andexpr ::= notexpr | notexpr 'and' andexpr ;
notexpr ::= basexpr | 'not' baseexpr ;
basexpr ::= atom | uop atom | atom bop basexpr ;
uop ::= 'context' | 'defined' | '$' | 'lc' | 'uc' ;
bop ::= '=' | '!=' | '>' | '<' | '>=' | '<=' | '~' ;
atom ::= context identifier, TWiki variable name, single-quoted string, or configuration item
</verbatim>
| *Operators* ||
| =AND= | True if both sides are true |
| =OR= | True if one or other side is true |
| =NOT= | negate the following expression |
| <nop>=, !<nop>= | String comparison |
| =lc(x)= | Converts x to lower case, Use for caseless comparisons. |
| =uc(x)= | Converts x to UPPER CASE. Use for caseless comparisons. |
| =d2n(x)= | Converts a date/time (expressed in [[TimeSpecifications][one of the formats that TWiki can parse]]) to a number of seconds since 1st Jan 1970. You should always convert a string date using =d2n= before you compare it with another date. Times without a timezone are assumed to be in server local time. |
| &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;= | Comparison. If both terms are numbers, the order is numeric. Otherwise it is alphabetic (applies to all comparison operators) |
| =~= | wildcard match ('*' will match any number of characters, '?' will match any single character e.g. "$WIKINAME ~ '*Smit?'") |
| context | True if the current context is set (see below) |
| defined | True if a preference variable or url parameter of this name is defined. |
| $ | expands a URL parameter or [[TWikiVariables][TWikiVariable]]. Plugin handlers *are not called*. Built-in variables and user-defined preferences are supported. You can pass a limited subset of parameters to TWiki variables by enclosing the variable name in single quotes; for example, =$ 'VARIABLE{value}'=. The ='VARIABLE{value}'= string may *not* contain quotes (' or "). |
examples:
<verbatim>
TWiki variable defined or not
%IF{"defined WIKINAME" then="WIKINAME is defined" else="WIKINAME is not defined"}%

You are %IF{ "$ WIKINAME='TWikiGuest' and not defined OPEN_DAY" then="not" }% allowed to
%IF{ "context view" then="view" else="edit"}% this TWiki today.

URL parameter
%IF{ "defined search" then="Search: $percntURLPARAM{search}$percnt" else="No search passed in"}%

Configuration item set or not
%IF{ "{AntiSpam}{HideUserDetails}" then="User details are hidden" }%

url param t is %IF{ "0 < $ t and $ t < 1000" then="in" else="out of"}% range.

Text comparison
%IF{ "$'URLPARAM{scope}'='text'" then="Plain text search" }% 
</verbatim>

*Configuration items* are defined in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]]. You cannot see the value of a configuration item, you can only see if the item is set or not.

*Context identifiers* are used in TWiki to label various stages of the rendering process. They are especially useful for [[TWikiSkins][skin]] authors to find out where they are in the rendering process. The following context identifiers are available:
| *id* | *context* |
| absolute_urls | Set if absolute URLs are required |
| authenticated | a user is authenticated |
| body_text  | when the body text is being processed in a view (useful in plugin handlers) |
| can_login | current environment supports login |
| changes | in changes script (see TWikiScripts) |
| command_line | the running script was run from the command line, and not from CGI |
| diff | in rdiff script (see TWikiScripts) |
| edit | in edit script (see TWikiScripts) |
| footer_text | when the footer text is being processed in a view (useful in plugin handlers) |
| header_text | when the header text is being processed in a view (useful in plugin handlers) |
| i18n_enabled | when user interface <nop>I18N support is enabled (i.e., user can choose the language for UI) |
| inactive | if active links such as 'edit' and 'attach' should be disabled |
| mirror | if this is a mirror |
| new_topic | if the topic doesn't already exist |
| oops | in oops script (see TWikiScripts) |
| preview | in preview script (see TWikiScripts) |
| rss | if this is an RSS skin rendering |
| save | in save script (see TWikiScripts) |
| search | in search script (see TWikiScripts) |
| view | in view script (see TWikiScripts) |
| rest | in rest script (see TWikiScripts) |
| registration_supported | registration is supported by the current UserMapper |

In addition there is a context identifier for each enabled plugin; for example, if =Gallous<nop>BreeksPlugin= is installed *and enabled*, then the context ID =Gallous<nop>BreeksPluginEnabled= will be set. Other extensions may set additional context identifiers.

The =%<nop>IF%= statement is deliberately kept simple. In particular, note that there is no way to conditionally execute a Set statement. If you need more sophisticated control over formatting, then consider using the SpreadSheetPlugin.
