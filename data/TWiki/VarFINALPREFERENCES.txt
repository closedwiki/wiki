#VarFINALPREFERENCES
---+++ FINALPREFERENCES -- list of preferences which must not be overridden


A comma separated list of preference variables which must not be
overridden in subordinate settings.

TWiki preferences get their values from a hierarchy of sources:
   1 An distribution default may be defined in [[%TWIKIWEB%.%WIKIPREFSTOPIC%]].
   2 A site customisation in [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]] may override that value.
   3 Per-web customisation in individual [[%WEBPREFSTOPIC%]] topics can override that.
   4 Finally, per-user and per-topic settings can override that.

With a FINALPREFERENCES setting at one of the stages, any settings in
the following stages will be ignored.  Consider, for example, a
[[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]] containing the following setting:
<verbatim>
   * Set FINALPREFERENCES = WIKIWEBMASTER
</verbatim>
In this case none of the [[%WEBPREFSTOPIC%]] topics can override that,
WIKIWEBMASTER is a global setting for that site.
   * Usage: Evaluated by TWiki and not intended to be expanded in any topic.
   * Type: Preference variable defined in [[%TWIKIWEB%.%WIKIPREFSTOPIC%]].  Can be customized for a TWiki site in [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]], and for each web in their %WEBPREFSTOPIC% topics.
