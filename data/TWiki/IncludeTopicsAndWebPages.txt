---+!! Include Topics and Web Pages Using ==%<nop>INCLUDE{...}%== Variable

Use the ==%<nop>INCLUDE{...}%== variable to embed the content of another topic or web page inside a %WIKITOOLNAME% topic. The whole content or only parts of a page can be included. If needed, set a proxy server in %WIKIPREFSTOPIC%.

%TOC%


---++ Syntax

==%<nop>INCLUDE{ "page" pattern="reg-exp" rev="1.2" }%==

	* =="page"==: %BR%
	  The nameless parameter specifies the page to include. It is
		* The name of a topic located in the current web, e.g., ==%<nop>INCLUDE{"WebNotify"}%==
		* A =Web.Topic= name specifying a topic in another web, e.g., ==%<nop>INCLUDE{"%TWIKIWEB%.SiteMap"}%==
		* A full qualified URL with ==http== protocol, domain name and optional port number, e.g., ==%<nop>INCLUDE{"http://twiki.org:80/index.html"}%==. Supported content types are ==text/html== and ==text/plain==. The full page is included by default, but the HTML header and scripts are stripped in case it is a web page.

	* ==pattern="reg-exp"==: %BR%
	  The *pattern* parameter is optional and allows you to extract some parts of a web page. Specify a %TWIKIWEB%.RegularExpression that scans from start (='^'=) to end and contains the text you want to keep in parenthesis, e.g., ==pattern="^.*?(from here.*?to here).*"==. You need to make sure that the integrity of a web page is not compromised; for example, if you include a table, make sure to include everything including the table end tag.

	* ==rev="1.x"==: %BR%
	  The *rev* parameter is optional and allows you to include an earlier revision of a topic. This can be used to include an official version of a topic, e.g. one that has been signed of by management. This parameter does not apply to URLs.

__Note:__ All text of a topic is included unless you specify ==%<nop>STARTINCLUDE%==, ==%<nop>STOPINCLUDE%== and/or a *pattern* parameter. A pattern will only search between ==%<nop>STARTINCLUDE%== and ==%<nop>STOPINCLUDE%==.
