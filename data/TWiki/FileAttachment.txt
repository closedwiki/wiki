---++ Dev Reorg Note:

The latest version of <nop>FileAttachments includes attachments under revision control. It's in the 01 Sep 2001 TWiki release.

	* Current Dev topic: Codev.AttachmentsUnderRevisionControl 

-----

Each topic can have files attached to it. This is similar to an e-mail attachment. Just use your browser to upload or download a file.
	* To upload: Click on the Attach link at the bottom of each page. A form is shown where you can browse for a file and upload it. The uploaded file will show up in the <nop>FileAttachment table.
	* To download: Click on the file in the <nop>FileAttachment table.

*FileAttachment table*

Is a table that looks like this:

<table cellpadding=0 border=0 cellspacing=4>
<tr bgcolor="#99CCCC">
  <th>FileAttachment:
  </th><th> Action:
  </th><th> Size:
  </th><th> Date:
  </th><th> Who:
  </th><th> Comment:
  </th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> (attached file)
  </td><td> 
	(view, update, add)
  </td><td> (file size)
  </td><td> (upload date)
  </td><td> (uploaded by)
  </td><td> (file comment)
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

*Action* is:
	* *view:* View file. This is the same as clicking on the filename.
	* *update:* Update file that is already attached.
	* *add:* Add a new attachment.

*Remarks*
	* Once a file is attached it can be referenced in the topic by =%<nop>ATTACHURL%/{filename}= . Example:
		* Attach file: =Sample.txt=
		* Text is shown as: %PUBURL%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%/Sample.txt , i.e. it is a link.
	* GIF and JPG images can be attached and shown in the text like this:
		* Attach file: =Smile.gif=
		* Edit topic and write text: =%<nop>ATTACHURL%/Smile.gif=
		* Text is shown as: %PUBURL%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%/Smile.gif , i.e. it shows up as an image.
	* It is not possible to delete attached files with the current TWiki implementation. Contact %WIKIWEBMASTER% if you need to delete files.
