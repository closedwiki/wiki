---## TWiki Username vs. Login Username

This section only applies to you in case the server where %WIKITOOLNAME% is installed is authenticated and on an Intranet.

%WIKITOOLNAME% manages internally two usernames: Login username and Wiki username. 
	* *Login username:* When you login to the Intranet you use your existing login username, i.e. ==pthoeny==. This name is passed to %WIKITOOLNAME% by the ==REMOTE_USER== environment variable. %WIKITOOLNAME% uses this name internally to log topic changes. Login usernames are maintained by your system administrator.
	* *Wiki username:* Is your name in WikiNotation, i.e. ==PeterThoeny==. Your WikiName will be created when you register in TWikiRegistration; doing so will also create your personal home page.

__Note:__ When you refer to a WikiName of a user (your own or somebody else's) be sure to specify the %MAINWEB% web in front of the Wiki username, e.g. write ==%MAINWEB%.<nop>WikiUsername== or ==%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>WikiUsername==. This assures that the name will be linked automatically to the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, even if the text is written in a different %WIKITOOLNAME% web.

%WIKITOOLNAME% can map the Intranet username to the Wiki username automatically, provided that the Login username and Wiki username pair has been entered in the %MAINWEB%.%WIKIUSERSTOPIC% topic. This happens automatically when you register.
