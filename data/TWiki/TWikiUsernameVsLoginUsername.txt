---## TWiki Username vs. Login Username

This section applies only if your %WIKITOOLNAME% is installed on a server that is both *authenticated* and on an *intranet*.

%WIKITOOLNAME% internally manages two usernames: Login username and TWiki username.

	* *Login username:* When you login to the intranet, you use your existing login username, for example ==pthoeny==. This name is normally passed to %WIKITOOLNAME% by the ==REMOTE_USER== environment variable. %WIKITOOLNAME% uses this name internally to log topic changes. Login usernames are maintained by your system administrator.
	* *TWiki username:* This is your name in WikiNotation, for example ==PeterThoeny==, recorded when you register in TWikiRegistration; doing so also generates your personal home page in the %MAINWEB% web of your TWiki site.

%WIKITOOLNAME% can map the intranet username to the Wiki username automatically, provided that the Login username and Wiki username pair has been entered in the %MAINWEB%.%WIKIUSERSTOPIC% topic. This happens automatically when you register.

<blockquote>
__NOTE:__ *To correctly enter a WikiName* - your own or someone else's - be sure to specify the %MAINWEB% web in front of the Wiki username: write ==%MAINWEB%.<nop>WikiUsername== or ==%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>WikiUsername==. This assures that the name will be linked automatically to the %MAINWEB% web, where user home pages are stored, even if the text is entered in a different web.
