---+ Bulk Registration

The %MAINWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup can use %TOPIC% to register (i.e. create logins and UserTopics) for a group of people quickly. 
Create a table in the REGISTERTOPIC named below, setting each row to represent each user and each column to correspond to the metadata.
Then press the button on this page to perform registration for those users. 
Unlike normal registration the administrator is assumed to have correct email addresses for the users, so no verification is required.
If you set EmailUsersWithDetails to 0 the user will not be notified that they have an account. This can be helpful in preparing and verifying the account before inviting everyone to use it.
BulkResetPassword can be then used to notify everyone of their new account.


---++ Bulk Registration usage

Any fields you define in this table will end up in the User's topic. If a form (such as UserForm) is attached to NewUserTemplate then the data will go in as META:FIELDS, meaning that you can use SEARCH formfield constructs to search. 

If you use the UserForm then ensure that it contains all the fields you define here. Otherwise they will disappear when the user edits their home topic!

---+++ Mandatory fields
   * WikiName 
   * Email
   * !FirstName
   * !LastName 

---+++ Optional fields
   * LoginName - if not set will register with WikiName


---++ Settings
      * Set REGISTERTOPIC = %MAINWEB%.UnprocessedRegistrations
      * Set LOGTOPIC = %REGISTERTOPIC%Log

      * Set OVERWRITEHOMETOPICS = 0

---+++ Example format
The following should be inserted into your REGISTERTOPIC as a table.
<verbatim>
| FirstName | LastName | Email | WikiName | CustomFieldThis | SomeOtherRandomField | WhateverYouLike |
| Test | User | you@example.com | TestUser | A | B | C |
</verbatim>

To use this:
   1 Make sure that the Custom fields appear on the UserForm
   2 Copy the above table to your clipboard
   3 Click through and paste this on %REGISTERTOPIC%, save the topic and return here.
   4 Click the Bulk register button below
   5 Read %LOGTOPIC%
   6 When you are ready, you probably want to use the BulkResetPassword page

Notes:
   1 The first row of the table dictates the heading format and that the fieldnames must be plain, i.e. *must not contain bolded* entries.
   2 You are responsible for ensuring that the fieldnames appear in the [[%TWIKIWEB%.UserForm]]
   3 Only members of the %MAINWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup can run this.
