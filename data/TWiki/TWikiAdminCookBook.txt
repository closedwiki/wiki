---++ During Installation

---+++ Don't change anything in the %TWIKIWEB% web!

Everything you change during installation makes life a little bit harder next time you come to upgrade. So treat the TWiki web as read-only, and create your own local site web for customised documentation.

---+++ Rename Main web to User web

You can rename the =Main= web to =User=. It will make WikiWord links to usernames more meaningful (<nop>User.UserName instead of <nop>Main.UserName); but does not bring much gain for other types of topics like (<nop>User.EngineeringGroup). Use the Rename Web feature in the %MAINWEB%.WebPreferences topic of any web you want to rename.

---+++ Help with remembering passwords

Users keep Forgetting Passwords (see TWiki:Codev.ForgettingPasswords ). When demonstrating TWiki to new users and/or helping them with TWikiRegistration, do not forget to show the user how to use the "remember my password" feature in their browser.

---++ Before First Presentation

Tips about first presentation -- ATasteOfTWiki is a handy presentation you can give to your users. Read also TWiki:Main.TWikiCourseOutlineExample and TWiki:Codev.HowToGetInternalBuyInForTWiki. There are a number of other presentations on TWiki.org (in the Codev web) that you might like to browse.

How to build participation: read WikiOrg:TipsForSiteOperators - advice directly from Ward Cunningham, author of Wiki concept and first Wiki.

---+++ Simplify menu in page templates

*How to get nice pages with simpler menu options for beginners*

A *Skin* is TWiki's way to present different system-generated formats (like header/footer/sidebar menu) *and exactly the same* information from the page body (see TWikiSkins). The "Classic" TWiki skin is oriented towards advanced power users. _Newbies_ may feel overwhelmed by the number of options. Many simpler custom skins are in development at TWiki:Plugins.WebHome. Consider using a simpler custom skin to make a better "first impression": _TWiki is simple to use._ 

There are other skins available for download. Visit the TWiki:Plugins.WebHome web on TWiki.org for a full list.

---+++ Customize tutorial for beginners 

Select simpler skin and customize beginner's help topics accordingly.

Please add your favorite TWiki tips/trick to TWiki:%WEB%.%TOPIC% to help the next new TWiki admin. (One BIG area: include pages of implemented basic SEARCHes, like, to generate a straight TOPICS list (alphabetical web topic titles only); also, simple combos of forms + search, like one- and two-category forms to use to classify pages, and then searches to find and display in few useful formats; more in that general area.)
