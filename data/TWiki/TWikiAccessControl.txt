%WIKITOOLNAME% allows to define some restrictions of who is allowed to make changes and attach files to topics.

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* Is is recommended to use the access control feature only if absolutely necessary because it goes against the free WikiCulture, where everybody is invited to contribute to any topic.

__Users and Groups__

Access control is based on users and groups.

__Users__ are defined by the user topics in the %MAINWEB% web, i.e. %MAINWEB%.TWikiGuest
	* Users can be authenticated using basic authentication or SSL. <A href="TWikiDocumentation#installation">Installation Notes</A> has more.

__Groups__ are defined by group topics in the %MAINWEB% web, i.e. %MAINWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup
	* A group topic name must end in *...Group*
	* The group topic should define these two variables:
		* Set <nop>GROUP = &lt; list of users and groups &gt;
		* Set <nop>ALLOWTOPICCHANGE = &lt; list of users and groups &gt;
	* GROUP defines the members of the group; it is a comma delimited list of users and other groups. Example: <br> =&nbsp; &nbsp; * Set <nop>GROUP = %MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeUser, %MAINWEB%.<nop>OtherUser, %MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeOtherGroup=
	* ALLOWTOPICCHANGE defines who is allowed to change the group topic; it is a comma delimited list of users and groups. You typically want to restrict that to the members of the group itself, so it should contain the name of the topic, i.e. <br> =&nbsp; &nbsp; * Set <nop>ALLOWTOPICCHANGE = %MAINWEB%.<nop>TWikiAdminGroup= <br> for the <nop>TWikiAdminGroup topic. (This is to prevent users not in the group from editing the topic and gaining unauthorized membership to the group.)


__Access Control for Individual Topics__

You can define some restrictions of who is allowed to make changes and attach files to a topic.

Define one or both of these variables in a topic, preferably at the end of the topic:
	* Set <nop>DENYTOPICCHANGE = &lt; list of users and groups &gt;
	* Set <nop>ALLOWTOPICCHANGE = &lt; list of users and groups &gt;

DENYTOPICCHANGE defines users or groups that *are not* allowed to make changes to the topic. It is a comma delimited list of users and groups. Example: <br> =&nbsp; &nbsp; * Set <nop>DENYTOPICCHANGE = %MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeBadBoy, %MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeBadGirl, %MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeHackerGroup=

ALLOWTOPICCHANGE defines users or groups that *are* allowed to make changes to the topic. It is a comma delimited list of users and groups. Example: <br> =&nbsp; &nbsp; * Set <nop>ALLOWTOPICCHANGE = %MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeGoodGuy, %MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeGoodGirl, %MAINWEB%.<nop>TWikiAdminGroup=

DENYTOPICCHANGE is evaluated before ALLOWTOPICCHANGE. Access is denied if the authenticated person is in the DENYTOPICCHANGE list, or not in the ALLOWTOPICCHANGE list. Access is granted in case DENYTOPICCHANGE and ALLOWTOPICCHANGE is not defined.

__Access Control per %WIKITOOLNAME% Web__

You can define some restrictions of who is allowed to make changes and attach files to topics or create new topics in a %WIKITOOLNAME% web.

Define one or both of these variable in the WebPreferences topic:
	* Set <nop>DENYWEBCHANGE = &lt; list of users and groups &gt;
	* Set <nop>ALLOWWEBCHANGE = &lt; list of users and groups &gt;

The same rules apply like the one for Access Control for Individual Topics; with these additions:
	* DENYTOPICCHANGE (in topic) overrides DENYWEBCHANGE (in <nop>WebPreferences)
	* ALLOWTOPICCHANGE (in topic) overrides ALLOWWEBCHANGE (in <nop>WebPreferences)
