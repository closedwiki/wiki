#VarENCODE

---+++ ENV{"varname"} -- inspect the value of an environment variable

Returns the current value of the environment variable in the CGI (Common Gateway Interface) environment. This is the environment that the TWiki scripts run in on the web server. For security reasons, only those variables whose names match the regulare expression in ={AccessibleENV}= in the *Security Settings/Miscellaneous* section of =configure= can be displayed. Any other variable will just be shown as the empty string, irrespective of its real value.

Example: %<nop>ENV{MOD_PERL}% displays as: %ENV{MOD_PERL}%

If a variable is not set (as against being set to the empty string) it will be returned as =not set=.
