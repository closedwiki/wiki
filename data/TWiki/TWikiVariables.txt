---# TWiki Variables

_Special text strings expand on the fly to display user data or system info_

<nop>TWikiVariables are text strings - =%<nop>VARIABLE%= - that expand into content whenever a page is rendered for viewing. Some variables can even take parameters - =%<nop>VARIABLE{parameter="value"}%=.

   * To leave a variable unexpanded, precede it with an exclamation point, e.g. type =!%<nop>TOPIC%= to get !%TOPIC%.
   * Variables are expanded relative to the topic they are _used_ in, not the topic they are _defined_ in.
   * Optional plugins may extend the set of predefined variables

---++ Setting Variables
You can set variables in all the following places:
   1 local site level in %LOCALSITEPREFS%
   1 user level in individual user topics in %MAINWEB% web
   1 web level in %WEBPREFSTOPIC% of each web
   1 topic level in topics in webs
   1 plugin topics (see TWikiPlugins)
   1 session variables (if sessions are enabled)

Settings at higher-numbered levels override settings of the same variable at lower numbered levels, unless the variable was included in the setting of FINALPREFERENCES at a lower-numbered level, in which case it is locked at the value it has at that level.

There are many [[#PreDef][predefined variables]] defined by default, and many more may already have been defined for your site. You can put !%ALL_VARIABLES% into a topic anywhere in your TWiki to get a full listing of the variables defined there.

The syntax for setting Variables is the same anywhere in TWiki (on its own TWiki bullet line, including nested bullets): <br />[multiple of 3 spaces] * [space] Set [space] VARIABLENAME [space] = [value]
<blockquote style="background-color:#f9f9f9">
*Examples:*
   * ==<nop>Set VARIABLENAME = value==
      * ==<nop>Set VARIABLENAME = value==
</blockquote>
Spaces between the = sign and the value will be ignored. You can split a value over several lines by starting following lines with [multiple of 3 spaces] - as long as you don't try to use * as the first character on the following line.
<blockquote style="background-color:#f9f9f9">
*Example:*
<pre>
   * <nop>Set VARIABLENAME = value starts here
   and continues here
</pre>
</blockquote>

Whatever you include in your Variable will be expanded on display, exactly as if it had been entered directly.

<blockquote style="background-color:#f9f9f9">
*Example: Create a custom logo variable* <br />
   * To place a logo anywhere in a web by typing ==%<nop>MYLOGO%==, define the Variable on the web's WebPreferences page, and upload a logo file, ex: =mylogo.gif=. You can upload by [[FileAttachment][attaching the file]] to WebPreferences, or, to avoid clutter, to any other topic in the same web, ex: =LogoTopic= - Sample variable setting in WebPreferences:
      * ==<nop>Set MYLOGO = %<nop>PUBURL%/<nop>TWiki/LogoTopic/mylogo.gif== 
</blockquote>

You can also set preference variables on a topic by clicking the link =Edit topic preference settings= under =More topic actions=. Preferences set in this manner are not visible in the topic text, but take effect nevertheless.

---+++ Access Control Variables
You should review TWikiAccessControl for details about security settings, which are managed using TWikiVariables.

---+++ Local values for variables
Certain topics (a users home topic, web site and default preferences topics) have a problem; variables defined in those topics can have two meanings. For example, consider a user topic. A user may want to use a double-height edit box when they are editing their home topic - but *only* when editing their home topic. The rest of the time, they want to have a normal edit box. This separation is achieved using =Local= in place of =Set= in the variable definition. For example, if the user sets the following in their home topic:
<verbatim>
   * Set EDITBOXHEIGHT = 10
   * Local EDITBOXHEIGHT = 20
</verbatim>
Then when they are editing any other topic, they will get a 10 high edit box. However when they are editing their home topic, they will get a 20 high edit box.
=Local= can be used wherever a preference needs to take a different value depending on where the current operation is being performed.

Use this powerful feature with great care! %<nop>ALL_VARIABLES% can be used to get a listing of the values of all variables in their evaluation order, so you can see variable scope if you get confused.

#PreDef
---++ Predefined Variables

Most predefined variables return values that were either set in the configuration when TWiki was installed, or taken from server info (like current username, or date and time). Some, like =%<nop>SEARCH%, are powerful and general tools.

   * %X% Predefined variables can be overridden by Preferences variables
   * %X% Plugins may extend the set of predefined variables _see individual Plugins topics for details_
   * %T% *Take the time to thoroughly read through ALL preference variables.* If you actively configure your site, review variables periodically. They cover a wide range of functions, and it can be easy to miss the one perfect variable for something you have in mind. For example, see ==%<nop>INCLUDINGTOPIC%==, ==%<nop>INCLUDE%==, and the mighty ==%<nop>SEARCH%==.
This version of TWiki - %WIKIVERSION% - predefines the following variables
