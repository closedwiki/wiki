---## TWiki Skins

Skins are customized [[TWikiTemplates][TWikiTemplate]] files. You can use skins to change the look of a %WIKITOOLNAME% topic, for example the layout of the header and footer. Note that the renderd text between header and footer does __not__ change. You can also use skins to define an alternate view, ex: a view optimized for printing.

Skin files are located in the ==twiki/template== directory and are name with this syntax: ==&lt;scriptname&gt;.&lt;skin&gt;.tmpl==. For example, the ==print== skin for the ==view== template is ==view<font color="red">.print</font>.tmpl== (red color added for clarification).

A skin can be activated in two ways:
	* Define the SKIN preference variable in TWiki.TWikiPreferences, one of the WebPreferences, or a user preference. Ex: 
		* =Set SKIN = print=
	* Add =?skin=name= to the URL, for this example:
		* %SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?skin=print (for the print view skin)
		* %SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?skin=plain (for the plain view skin that has no header and footer)

The ==?skin=name== URL parameter overrides the SKIN preference value.
