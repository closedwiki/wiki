---++ TWiki variables used by !DragonSkin
The following TWiki.TWikiVariables are specific to !DragonSkin and control various look and feel aspects of the skin:

	$ DS_BODYFONTSIZE: CSS font size for the overall body of the page.
	$ DS_LEFTMENUFONTSIZE: CSS font size for the left menu (relative size values will compound with the body font size).
	$ DS_EDITBARFONTSIZE: CSS font size for the edit/attach/etc menubar on the top of each view page (relative size values will compound with the body font size).
	$ DS_FONTFAMILY: CSS font family.  Applies to all pages.
	$ DS_QUICKLINKSDISPLAY: Set this variable to &quot;none&quot; to turn off display of the quicklinks menu.
	$ DS_QUICKLINKSHEADING: String to use for the quicklinks submenu heading.
	$ DS_QUICKLINKS: HTML unordered list containing the quicklinks menu items.
	$ DS_TOPICCSS: CSS statements that will get embedded in every view page (meant for adding short bits of style to a specific topic).  These CSS statements are *only* included in view pages, not in edit, preview or oops pages. See the section below on &quot;Recovering from a bad DS_TOPICCSS setting&quot; for reasons why.  Surround a  topic-specific CSS setting with HTML comments to hide the CSS statements. Set the variable to a blank value on your wiki home page to disable seeing custom css styles.
	$ DS_THEME: Lets one chose between various look and feels.  Supported themes at this time are "gray" (the default), "monochrome", and "tabstyle".

You can test out settings on one page (such as a [[Sandbox.WebHome][Sandbox]] page) using variables set within that topic.

The colored bands on the top and bottom of each page is set via the standard TWiki WEBBGCOLOR variable.  This is usually set on a per-web basis, in order to provide a consistent indication of which web a page is in.

---++ Built-in CSS styles
The following CSS styles are included with Dragonskin as a convenience.  Your local administrator may add additional classes:
	$ ds-draft: Text within a div of class ds-draft will be displayed with a tiled background containing light gray images with the word "DRAFT".
	$ ds-kbd: Text within a div of class ds-kbd will be displayed in monospaced type w/in an	 indented light-gray box.
	$ ds-note: Text within a div of class ds-note will be displayed as a yellow "Post-it" style note on the right-side of the page.

To use these classes, enclose your text in a div of that class.  For example:<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;ds-note&quot;&gt;<br />
