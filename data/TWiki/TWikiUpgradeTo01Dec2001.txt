---## TWiki Upgrade Guide

_Upgrading from the TWiki 01-Dec-2000 to the new 01-Sep-2001 release_

---+++ Overview

The latest version of TWiki (01-Sep-2001) involves several major new features and numerous enhancements from the last full version (01-Dec-2001). The file system set-up is almost identical, but much of the underlying data structure and procedures are new. With all the changes, the upgrade procedure is straightforward, and your existing page data is imported directly. 

---+++ Upgrade Requirements for TWiki 01-Sep-2001 

	* To upgrade from a 01-Dec-2000 standard installation to the new, next generation 01-Sep-2001 TWiki Production Release, follow the instructions below.

	* __NOTE:__ To upgrade from a _pre-01-Dec-2000_ TWiki, start with	%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiUpgradeTo01Dec2000.

	* To upgrade from a Beta of the new release, or if you've made custom modifications, read through the documentation and use the procedure below as a guideline.  

---+++ Major Changes from TWiki 01-Dec-2000

The 01 Sep 2001 release includes the following new features and enhancements:

	* *[[TWikiPlugins][TWiki Plugins]]* - Easily install program enhancements using external plug-in modules. Developers can create plug-ins in Perl, with the [[TWikiPlugins#PluginAPI][TWiki Plugin API]].
		* *[[InterwikiPlugin][InterwikiPlugin]]* (preinstalled) - Link to external sites with text aliases, =SiteAlias:Page=; rules are defined in InterWikis. (Get more Plugins from the TWiki:Plugins web.) 
	* *[[TWikiTemplateSystem][TWikiTemplateSystem]]* - New, more flexible template system.
	* *[[TWikiSkins][TWikiSkins]]* - Overwrite template headers and footers; page content is unaffected. 
	* *[[TWikiMetaData][TWikiMetaData]]* - New data format 
	* *[[TWikiFormTemplate][TWikiFormTemplate]]* - Create multiple input forms per web; data is rendered in HTML tables.
	* *[[ManagingTopics][Rename/move/delete topics]]* Individual pages can be managed  through the browser. Deleted topics are stored in a common Trash web.
	* *[[TWikiUserAuthentication#ChangingPasswords][Change passwords]]* Change and reset passwords using forms 
	* *TOC (Table of Contents)* - =%<nop>TOC%= variable generates a hierarchical table of contents from topic headings: &lt;HI&gt;...&lt;H6&gt;. Set depth.
	* *ArbitraryTextForWikiWordLinks* - Text formatting rules to form links from any combination of words and spaces.
	* *AttachmentsUnderRevisionControl* Changes to files attached to topics - FileAttachments - are now tracked under revision control (RCS).
	* *ConvertToXHTML10* - Templates and HTML page rendering are in XHTML 1.0 as far as possible without breaking HTML 3.2 compliance.
	* *HierarchicalNavigation*

The TWiki directory structure remains the same, with one exception, the new =lib/TWiki/Plugins= directory tree to for the main configuration file, library, internal modules and the new Plugin modules. Pre-existing files were formerly in =bin=.

---+++ Six-Step Standard Upgrade

Follow this step-by-step guide to upgrade the 01 Dec 2000 version to the 01 Sep 2001 release, and import your original page data:

---++++ Step 1: Backup & Unpack

		1. Backup all existing TWiki directories ( =bin=, =pub=, =data=, =templates= )

		1. Unpack the zip file into some working directory:
	  <br> =mkdir -p ~/tmp/=
	  <br> =cd ~/tmp=
	  <br> =unzip ~/TWiki20001201.zip=

---++++ Step 2: Upgrade TWiki document files 

		1. Move the document files to your TWiki root ( =twiki= ):
		  <br> =mv ~/tmp/TWiki*.html $TWIKIROOT=
		  <br> =mv ~/tmp/index.html $TWIKIROOT=
		  <br> =mv ~/tmp/readme.txt $TWIKIROOT=
		  <br> =mv ~/tmp/license.txt $TWIKIROOT=

---++++ Step 3: Upgrade CGI scripts

		1. Rename your original =twiki/bin= directory: ( =twiki/bin= )
		  <br> =mv $TWIKIROOT/bin $TWIKIROOT/bin.old=
		1. Move the new scripts to your original =twiki/bin= location, i.e.
		  <br> =mv ~/tmp/bin $TWIKIROOT/bin=
		1. Merge the changes in your current =wikicfg.pm= into the new =wikicfg.pm=. We suggest using =diff -c= to compare the two files if you have made heavy changes to the file:
		  <br> =diff -c $TWIKIROOT/bin.old/wikicfg.pm $TWIKIROOT/bin/wikicfg.pm | less=
		1. Restore any additional scripts you might have from the old directory, ex:
		  <br> =mv $TWIKIROOT/bin.old/somescript $TWIKIROOT/bin/=
		1. Test your TWiki installation if you can view topics.
		  
		* Pay attention to the file and directory permissions (security issue)

---++++ Step 4: Upgrade template files 

		1. Rename your original =twiki/templates= directory: ( =twiki/templates= )
		  <br> =mv $TWIKIROOT/templates $TWIKIROOT/templates.old=
		1. Move the new templates to your original =twiki/templates= location:
		  <br> =mv ~/tmp/templates $TWIKIROOT/templates=
		1. __Merge the changes in your current template files into the new template files. To compare two files use
		  <br> =diff -c $TWIKIROOT/templates.old/view.tmpl $TWIKIROOT/templates/view.tmpl | less=__
		1. Restore any additional template subdirectories of your TWiki webs you might have and merge the changes.
		1. Test your TWiki installation to see if you can view topics.

---++++ Step 5: Upgrade public files

		1. Move the new =twiki/pub/TWiki= directory to your installation: ( =twiki/pub= )
		  <br> =mv ~/tmp/pub/TWiki $TWIKIROOT/pub/=
		1. Move the new =twiki/pub/twikilogo*= image files to your installation:
		  <br> =mv ~/tmp/pub/twikilogo* $TWIKIROOT/pub=
		  
		* Pay attention to the file permissions of the =TWiki= directory and its subdirectory and files. The files must be writable by the CGI scripts (usually user "nobody").

---++++ Step 6: Upgrade data files 

		1. Move the new =twiki/data/TWiki= directory to your installation: ( =twiki/data= )
		  <br> =mv ~/tmp/data/TWiki $TWIKIROOT/data/=
		  <br> Pay attention to the file permissions of the =TWiki= directory and its files. The files must be writable by the cgi-scripts (usually user "nobody")
		1. Optionally move the new =twiki/data/Test= directory to your installation,
		  <br> =mv ~/tmp/data/Test $TWIKIROOT/data/=
		  <br> (Pay attention to the file permissions)
		1. =TWikiRegistration= moved from TWiki.Main to TWiki.TWiki. In case you customized =TWikiRegistration= , merge your changes back into =TWiki.TWikiRegistration= , then delete =$TWIKIROOT/data/Main/TWikiRegistration*=.
		1. =TWikiPreferences= into =TWiki.TWikiPreferences=.
		1. Merge your changes to the =WebPreferences= topics in all your webs into =WebPreferences=
		1. Modify the =WebPreferences= topics in all your webs to reflect the following:
			* =WEBTOPICLIST= should use =WebChanges= for ="Changes"=, and =WebIndex= for ="Index"=:
			  <br> =| &lt;a href="WebChanges"&gt;Changes&lt;/a&gt;=
			  <br> =| &lt;a href="WebIndex"&gt;Index&lt;/a&gt;=
			* In case you want to exclude a web from a =web="all"= search: Set this new preference
			  <br> =Set NOSEARCHALL = on=
		1. The =WebSearch= topic has considerable changes. Copy the one from =TWiki.TWiki= into all webs, or merge them if you made changes. To copy, do an edit-copy-edit-paste operation.
		1. __Change the =WebHome= topics in all your webs to reflect these changes:__
