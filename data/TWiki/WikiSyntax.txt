---# <nop>Instant TWiki Shorthand

If you can enter text, write an email, you're ready for TWiki. Use simple, intuitive TWiki shorthand to get even more control - instantly!

	* Separate each *paragraph* with a blank line.

	* To display a word or phrase in *bold type*, put it in asterisks: =*bold type*=.

	* To display a word or phrase in _italic_, put it in underscores: =_italic_=.

	* To display a word or phrase in __bold italic__, put it in _double_ underscores: =__bold italic__=.

	* To link to another Wiki topic, type the WikiWord for that topic. To link to a Wiki topic in another web, type the name of the web, and a dot, first: =Test.<nop>%HOMETOPIC%=.
	
		* When entering WikiName signatures - like, %USERNAME% - include the %MAINWEB% as a prefix, since all TWiki member pages are in the %MAINWEB% web: =Main.YourName=.

	* If you enter a WikiWord for a topic that doesn't exist, it  appears highlighted, with a question mark link at the end, prompting you (or someone else) to start off the new topic by clicking the *?* - FreshTopic (try clicking the *?*, but don't save, or you'll create a ==<nop>FreshTopic== page and ruin this example).

	* For an external link, type the full URL: =http://twiki.org= = http://twiki.org 

	* To prevent a WikiWord from becoming a link, type =&lt;nop&gt;= first, ==&lt;nop&gt;WikiWord== = <nop>WikiWord

	* To indent with a bullet, enter =[space][space][space][asterisk][space]=.
		* Use multiples of 3 spaces to start *nested bullets*.
			* That's 3-6-9-...
		1 Start items in a *numbered list* with =[space][space][space][1][space]=.
		1 The "1" (or *any number*) will be replaced by the correct number, in order.

	* Always start *counting spaces* for bullets and such from the beginning of a new line.

	* To include an image, type its URL. You also can Attach an image to the page and display it with text <br />=%<nop>ATTACHURL%/yourimagefilename.jpg=.

	* To display a word or phrase in =MONOSPACED type=, put it in equal signs: =<nop>=like this==. <br />Use =<nop>=<nop>=two=== for bold: ==bold mono==.

<pre>
	  Surround code excerpts, filenames, and other
	  unformatted text with &lt;pre&gt; or &lt;/pre&gt;
	  or the special TWiki use &lt;verbatim&gt; and 
	  &lt;/verbatim&gt; tags.
</pre>

	* Use three (or more) consecutive *hyphens* expands into a horizontal rule: =---=

	* See [[TextFormattingRules][TWikiShorthand]] for more....
