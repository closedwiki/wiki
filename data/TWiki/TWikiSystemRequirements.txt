---## TWiki Implementation Notes

---+++ Platform

TWiki is written in Perl 5 and uses also some shell commands. The current implementation runs best on a Unix machine, but it is also possible on Microsoft Windows. RCS (for revision control) must be installed on the system.

---+++ Directory Structure

| *Directory:*		  | *Used for:* |
| ==twiki/bin==		 | TWiki Perl scripts |
| ==twiki/bin/TWiki== | TWiki Perl modules |
| ==twiki/bin/TWiki/Plugins== | Plugins modules |
| ==twiki/pub==		 | Public files (FileAttachments, images) |
| ==twiki/data==		| source text |
| ==twiki/templates== | HTML templates, used by TWiki scripts |

__Note:__ You could move the ==twiki/bin/TWiki== library directory (including ==Plugins== ) to ==twiki/lib/TWiki==; the scripts look for a =="."== and =="../lib"== relative library path.
