---# TWiki System Requirements

_Server and client system requirements of TWiki 01-Sep-2001_

---++ Overview

Maintaining minimum client and server requirements is necessary to keep TWiki deployment as broad as possible. 

---++ Server-Side Requirements

TWiki is written in Perl 5 and uses a number of shell commands. It requires GNU RCS (Revision Control System) to be installed on the same system. TWiki is developed in a standard Linux/Apache environment. It can also work with Microsoft Windows and other platforms.

| *Required Server Environment* |||
| *Resource* | *Unix* | *Windows* |
| Perl |  5.005_03 or higher  ||
| Non standard Perl modules |  =Net::SMTP= (or =sendmail=)  |  =Net::SMTP=, =MIME::Base64=,  =Digest::SHA1= |
| RCS |  5.7 or higher  ||
| Other external programs |  =ls, fgrep, egrep=  ||
| Web server |  Apache; others (with support for CGI, authentication, extended path) ***  ||

Current documentation covers Linux only. Compiling a basic [[http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/TWikiOnWindows][TWikiOnWindows]] installation guide is an ongoing effort. 

---++ Client-Side Requirements

The TWiki standard installation has extremely low browser requirements:

	* HTML 3.2 compliant
	* minimal use of <nop>JavaScript in the user interface (degrades gracefully)
	* no cookies
	* no CSS

TWiki generates XHTML 1.0 code as long as it is compatible with HTML 3.2.

---++ Known Issues

	* The new TWikiPlugins feature currently does not have any compatibility guidelines for developers. Plugins can require just about anything: browser-specific functions, stylesheets (CSS), Java, cookies, etc.
