---# TWiki System Requirements

_Server and client requirements for TWiki 01-Feb-2003 (pending release)_

Low client and server requirements are core features that keep TWiki widely deployable, particularly across a range of browser platforms and versions.

---++ Server Requirements

TWiki is written in Perl 5, uses a number of shell commands, and requires [[http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/rcs.html][RCS (Revision Control System)]], a GNU Free Software package. TWiki is developed in a basic Linux/Apache environment. It also works with Microsoft Windows, and should have no problem on any other platform that meets the requirements.

| *Required Server Environment* |||
| *Resource* | *Unix* | *Windows** |
| Perl |  5.005_03 or higher (5.6.1 recommended)  ||
| Non-standard Perl modules |  =Net::SMTP= (or =sendmail=)  |  =Net::SMTP=, =MIME::Base64=, =Digest::SHA1=  |
| RCS |  5.7 or higher (including GNU =diff=) %BR% Optional, but the all-Perl replacement is not currently recommended for live sites - see TWiki:Codev/RcsLite.  ||
| GNU =diff= |  GNU =diff= 2.7 or higher is required when TWiki's uses RCS binaries.  %BR% Install on PATH if not included with RCS (check version with =diff -v=)  ||
| Other external programs |  =ls, fgrep, egrep=  ||
| Cron/scheduler |  =cron=  | =cron= equivalents |
| Web server |  Apache is well supported; for other servers, CGI support, authentication, extended path required  ||

%X% *** _Current documentation mainly covers Linux and Apache installations. See WindowsInstallCookbook for a Windows installation guide._

#ClientRequirements
---++ Client Requirements

The TWiki [[TWikiInstallationGuide][standard installation]] has extremely low browser requirements:

	* HTML 3.2 compliant
	* generates XHTML 1.0 pages that are compatible with HTML 3.2
	* minimal use of <nop>JavaScript in the user interface (degrades gracefully)
	* no cookies
	* no CSS

You can easily add functionality, by customizing TWikiTemplates, for one, while tailoring the browser requirements to your situation. 

---++ Known Issues

	* The new TWikiPlugins feature currently does not have compatibility guidelines for developers. Plugins can require just about anything -  browser-specific functions, stylesheets (CSS), Java applets, cookies, specific Perl modules,... - check the individual Plugin specs.
		* %H% Plugins included in the TWiki distribution do not add requirements.
