---# Managing Webs

_Adding, renaming and deleting webs is done directly on the server_

---++ Overview

Managing TWiki webs requires direct access to the installation files on the host server. There are no browser-based web tools.

---++ How to Add a New Web

Adding new webs is quick and easy - you can have a basic web up and running in a couple of minutes:

	1. *Create* a new directory under ==twiki/data/==, ex: =twiki/data/newweb=
	1. *Copy* in the contents of =twiki/data/_default=.

For detailed instructions: [[TWikiDocumentation#CreateWeb][TWiki Installation Guide: Creating a New Web]].

---++ How to Rename or Delete a Web

*NOTE:* Think twice if you intend to rename the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, since many files point to it. If you rename it, you also have to change all occurrences of =Main= to the new web name (like the web prefixes for all user signatures, =Main.<nop>SomeName=). (On the other hand, if the =%<nop>MAINWEB%= variable is used throughout, you won't have that problem.)
	1. Prepare your site: Other webs may link to the web you want to rename or delete. Search each web for links to the target web: search all webs for =Abouttochange.= - include the period to find topics like =Abouttochange.SomeTopic=. Make changes as required.
	1. Edit the %WIKIPREFSTOPIC% topic: Rename or delete the web from the =WIKIWEBLIST= variable.
	1. Edit the TWikiWebsTable topic: Rename or delete the web from the table.
	1. Connect to the %WIKITOOLNAME% server: Login via Telnet or FTP.
	1. Edit the data files: Go to =twiki/data= and rename or delete the web directory.
	1. Edit the template files: Go to =twiki/templates= and rename or delete the web directory if present.
	1. Edit the public files: Go to =twiki/pub= and rename or delete the web directory if present.
