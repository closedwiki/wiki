---# Managing Webs

_Adding webs is a web based operation; renaming and deleting webs are manual operations done directly on the server_

---++ Overview

A TWikiSite is divided into webs; each one represents one subject, one area of collaboration. Administrators can add/rename/delete webs.

#WebTemplate
---++ Choose Web Template

There are two methods used to create a new web.  First you can use a specially designed TemplateWeb.  This is an invisible web that begins with an underscore &quot;_&quot; character.  All topics in the _default template web will be copied into your new web.

The second method is to use an existing web as a template web.  This may be useful if you already have a web that you like to use as a starting point.  Only topics that have names beginning with *Web...* (like "%HOMETOPIC%", "%NOTIFYTOPIC%", etc.) are copied.

In either case you will want to be sure to verify that your new web has all the custom modifications that you desire.

#CreateNewWeb
---++ Adding a New Web

<form name="admin" action="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/manage%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%INTURLENCODE{"%WEB%/%TOPIC%"}%" method="post">
Create a new web by filling out this form. __Note:__ It is not recommended to create a new web for each little project. You can organize content within a web using TWikiForms and FormattedSearch. Cross-linking topics and search is easier if there are only a few larger webs.
|  *Name of new web:* | <input name="newweb" type="text" value="%URLPARAM{"newweb"}%" size="16" /> | Enter a short name of up to 10 characters. The name must start with an upper case letters, followed by optional upper or lower case letters or numbers |
|  *Based on web:* | <select name="baseweb"> %WEBLIST{ "<option>$name</option>" webs="webtemplate,public" selection="_default" separator=" "}% </select> | Select a TemplateWeb |
|  *Web color:* | <input name="webbgcolor" type="text" value="#D0D0D0" size="16" /> | Enter a StandardColors code for the web |
|  *Description:<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;* | <input type="text" name="sitemapwhat" value="" size="60" /><br /> Enter a short description of the web. Write =Web.TopicName= instead of just =TopicName= if you include links. This will list the web in the %TWIKIWEB%.SiteMap (leave field empty if you prefer not to update the directory.) ||
|  *Use to...<br /> &nbsp;* | <input type="text" name="sitemapuseto" value="...collaborate on" size="60" /><br /> Continue the sentence describing the intended use. This is also for the %TWIKIWEB%.SiteMap ||
|  *Exclude web from "search all":* | <input type="radio" name="nosearchall" value="" checked="checked" /> No &nbsp; <input type="radio" name="nosearchall" value="on" /> Yes | Specify if you want to exclude the web from a "search all webs" search. Note that the %TWIKIWEB%.SiteMap will not list the web if you select Yes. |
| | <input type="submit" value="Create new web" /> ||
<input name="newtopic" type="hidden" value="%URLPARAM{"newtopic"}%" />
<input name="action" type="hidden" value="createweb" />
</form>

__Notes:__
	* Attachments will NOT get copied over along with their topics
	* The manage script while creating the new web will update the following variables in the WebPreferences: =WEBBGCOLOR=, =SITEMAPLIST=, =SITEMAPWHAT=, =SITEMAPUSETO= and =NOSEARCHALL=.  These variables are used to dynamically generate the SiteMap
	* This script does not edit the [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPreferences]] file to update the =WIKIWEBLIST=.  This must be done by hand
	* As of TWiki Release 01 Sep 2004, a web name can be a WikiWord. Prior to that it could be only =UPPER= or =UPPERlower=. A side effect of this is that if you do use a wiki name, =%<nop>WEB%= must be written as =&lt;nop&gt;%<nop>WEB%= or else it will try to link to a non-existing topic of that name

---++ Renaming or Deleting a Web

Renaming or deleting a web requires direct access to the installation files on the host server. There are currently no browser-based equivalents of the Rename/move/delete topic tools for working with webs.

---+++ Renaming the MAINWEB

If you plan to rename the %MAINWEB% web, remember that TWiki stores user and group topics in =%<nop>MAINWEB%=, default named =Main=. That means, every WikiName signature - =Main.<nop>SomeUserName= - points to it and would need updating (unless the variable, =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeUserName=, is used throughout).
	1. Prepare your site: Search each web for links to the target web, searching topic text for =Oldwebname.=, including the dot so you'll find references like =Oldwebname.SomeTopic=
		* Make changes as required, to =Newwebname.SomeTopic= or better yet, to =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeTopic=
	1. Edit the %WIKIPREFSTOPIC% topic: Rename or delete the web from the =WIKIWEBLIST= variable
	1. Login to the %WIKITOOLNAME% server, via Telnet or FTP
	1. Go to =twiki/data= and rename or remove the web directory
	1. Go to =twiki/templates= and rename or remove the web directory if present
		* __Note:__ See TWiki:Codev.RenameWebs for some complications
	1. Go to =twiki/pub= and rename or remove the web directory if present
