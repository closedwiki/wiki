---# Managing Webs

_Adding, renaming and deleting webs are manual operations done directly on the server_

---++ Overview

Managing TWiki webs requires direct access to the installation files on the host server. There are currently no browser-based equivalents of the Rename/move/delete topic tools for working with webs.

---++ Adding a New Web

Adding new webs is quick and easy - you can have a basic web up and running in a couple of minutes:

	1. *Create* a new directory under =twiki/data/=, ex: =twiki/data/Newweb= <br>
		* the name has to start with a capital and _cannot_ be a WikiWord
	1. *Copy* in the contents of =twiki/data/_default=.

For detailed instructions, see [[TWikiDocumentation#CreateWeb][TWiki Installation Guide: Adding a New Web]].

---++ Renaming or Deleting a Web

*NOTE:* If you plan to rename the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, remember that TWiki stores user and group topics in =%<nop />MAINWEB%=, default named =Main=. That means, every WikiName signature - =Main.<nop>SomeUserName= - points to it and would need updating (unless the variable, =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeUserName=, is used throughout).
	1. Prepare your site: Search each web for links to the target web, searching topic text for =Oldwebname.=, including the dot so you'll find references like =Oldwebname.SomeTopic=. 
		* Make changes as required, to =Newwebname.SomeTopic= or better yet, to ==%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeTopic=.
	1. Edit the %WIKIPREFSTOPIC% topic: Rename or delete the web from the =WIKIWEBLIST= variable.
	1. Edit the TWikiWebsTable topic: Rename or delete the web from the table.
	1. Login to the %WIKITOOLNAME% server, via Telnet or FTP.
	1. Go to =twiki/data= and rename or remove the web directory.
	1. Go to =twiki/templates= and rename or remove the web directory if present.
	1. Go to =twiki/pub= and rename or remove the web directory if present.
