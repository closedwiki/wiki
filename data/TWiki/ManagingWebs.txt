The current implementation of %WIKITOOLNAME% is designed to never forget.  So you can't delete a topic, however you can move or rename a topic and the original information is saved in topic meta data.  If you want an even stronger memory, you can disable renaming on some or all topics; see TWikiAccessControl.

---+++ How to Rename or Delete a Web

	* It is advisable not to rename the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web.
	* Be aware that other webs might link to the web you want to rename / delete. Search each web for links to this web, i.e. search all webs for =Obsolete.= (include the period, this is to find topics like =Obsolete.SomeTopic= ). Take measures if necessary.
	* Edit the %WIKIPREFSTOPIC% topic and rename / delete the web from the =WIKIWEBLIST= variable.
	* Edit the TWikiWebsTable topic and rename / delete the web from the table.
	* Telnet to the %WIKITOOLNAME% installation.
	* cd to ==twiki/data== and rename / delete the web directory.
	* cd to ==twiki/templates== and rename / delete the web directory if present.
	* cd to ==twiki/pub== and rename / delete the web directory if present.
