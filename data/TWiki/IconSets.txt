---+!! Icon Sets

*With Icon Sets every skin can have its own set of graphics/icons.*

%TOC%

---++ Icon Topic

For this a topic is assigned as the "icon topic" (by setting the variable =%<nop>ICONTOPIC%=). Each time an image is retrieved, TWiki will get it from the attachments folder of this topic.

To set ICONTOPIC, write in TWiki.TWikiPreferences:
<verbatim>
   * Set ICONTOPIC = TWiki.TWikiDocGraphicsPattern
</verbatim>
(default) or
<verbatim>
   * Set ICONTOPIC = TWiki.TWikiDocGraphics
</verbatim>

---++ Graphics

Graphics (smilies for instance) can be placed in a topic by using =%<nop>ICON{"icon name"}%=. You can use =%<nop>ICON{"help"}%= to get the image %ICON{"help"}%.%BR%
Previously, =%<nop>ICON{}%= would only retrieve file type icons. Now you can get any image that is in the icon topic attachment folder.

---++ File icons

File type icons are retrieved automatically, for instance when an attachment table is drawn.%BR%
The icon images are mapped from a lookup table in the file =_filetypes.txt= to decide which graphic to display. When a corresponding file icon is not found, the file =else.gif= is used. Previously, =_filetypes.txt= could be found in folder =/pub/icn/=, but now this file is also attached to the icon topic. When new file icons are added, this attachment file should be updated as well.

---++ Full image paths

To use Icon Set icons in a style sheet, call =%<nop>ICONPATH{"icon name"}%=. This will retrieve the whole (absolute) path of the image file.

For instance, write:
<verbatim>
a.toggleIcon { background:url(%ICONPATH{"toggleclose"}%) no-repeat; }
</verbatim>
This will get the path of the file =toggleclose.gif=.
