A <nop>WikiWord consists of two or more words with initial capitals, run together.

When you type a <nop>WikiWord, you establish a hyperlink. It's as easy as that.

<nop>WikiWords are styled like this because:

	* It makes Wiki hyperlinks instantly recognizable
	* It leads to interesting Wiki topics
	* It avoids the need to fiddle with HTML tags
	* It avoids over-general topics because at least two words are required

*Syntax of a <nop>WikiWord*

	* Uppercase letter(s)
	* Lowercase letter(s)
	* Uppercase letter(s)
	* Optional lowercase or uppercase letter(s) or number(s)

*Good examples for <nop>WikiWords:*

	* WikiWord
	* GoodStyle
	* AVeryLongWikiTopicNameIsAlsoPossible: wherever an uppercase or lowercase letter is allowed, a group of letters of the same case is allowed
	* YearTwoThousand

*Bad examples for <nop>WikiWords:*

	* Web: Name without the uppercase letter(s), lowercase letter(s), uppercase letter(s) sequence
	* T5Wiki: Name with number before the uppercase, lowercase, uppercase sequence
	* Md5sumsAfterBurning: Name with number before the uppercase, lowercase, uppercase sequence
	* Know-How: Name with dashes in between

*Hints*

	* Insert <nop>WikiWords wherever you can. Rich linking helps to make a Wiki successful.
	* Be specific. All topics in a web share one name space. For example, instead of =FunctionalSpec= write =BreadSlicerFunctionalSpec= because other projects might also have a functional spec topic.
	* %H% To stop a <nop>WikiWord from being turned into a hyperlink, insert the text =&lt;nop&gt;= immediately before the <nop>WikiWord.
	* It is recommended to create topics with singular names. Plural <nop>WikiWords are automatically linked to the singular topic, i.e. the link WikiWords links to the topic WikiWord.
	* Sometimes you have to be creative to find a good <nop>WikiName. Examples:
		* To create a topic about the the *Bread Slicer 1.2* product, use =BreadSlicer1dot2= or =BreadSlicer1pt2=, but not =BreadSlicer1.2=.
		* To create a topic about *year 2000*, you could go for =YearTwoK= or =YearTwoThousand=, but not =Year2K= or =Y2K= or =Y2000=.
	* Turn acronyms into <nop>WikiWords, i.e. take =FaqIndex= for a "FAQ index" topic.
	* You can specify any link label by using double square brackets, e.g. write =[<nop>[TWikiAccessControl][access control]]= to get a link to TWikiAccessControl that looks like [[TWikiAccessControl][access control]].
	* %X% The topic is assumed to be in the current TWiki web.  Prepending the name of a TWiki web and a period links to a topic in another web.
