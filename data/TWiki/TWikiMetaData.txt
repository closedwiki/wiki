#MetaDataDefinition
---# TWiki Meta Data

_Additional topic data, program-generated or from TWikiForms, is stored in =META= variable name/value pairs_

---++ Overview

TWikiMetaData uses =META= variables to store topic data that's separate from the main free-form content. This includes program-generated info like FileAttachment and topic movement data, and user-defined TWikiForms info. Use =META= variables to format and display Meta Data.  

---++ Meta Data Syntax

	* Format is the same as in TWikiVariables, except all fields have a key.
		* =%<nop>META:&lt;type&gt;{key1="value1" key2="value2" ...}%=

	* Order of fields within the meta variables is not defined, except that if there is a field with key =name=, this appears first for easier searching (note the order of the variables themselves is defined).

	* Each meta variable is on one line.

	* =\n= (new line) is represented in values by =%<nop>_<nop>N_<nop>= and ="= (double-quotes) by =%<nop>_Q_%=.

---++ Meta Data Specifications

The current version of Meta Data is 1.0, with support for the following variables.

---+++ META:TOPICINFO

|  *Key*  |  *Comment*			 |
| version | Same as RCS version |
| date	 | integer, unx time, seconds since start 1970 |
| author  | last to change topic, is the REMOTE_USER |
| format  | Format of this topic, will be used for automatic format conversion |

---+++ META:TOPICMOVED

This is optional, exists if topic has ever been moved.  If a topic is moved more than once, only the most recent META:TOPICMOVED meta variable exists in the topic, older ones are to be found in the rcs history.

=%<nop>META:TOPICMOVED{from="Codev.OldName" to="Codev.NewName" by="talintj" date="976762680"}%=

|  *Key*  |  *Comment*			 |
| from | Full name, i.e., web.topic |
| to	| Full name, i.e., web.topic |
| by	| Who did it, is the REMOTE_USER, not <nop>WikiName |
| date | integer, unx time, seconds since start 1970 |

Notes: 
	* at present version number is not supported directly, it can be inferred from the RCS history.
	* there is only one META:TOPICMOVED in a topic, older move information can be found in the RCS history.
 
---+++ META:TOPICPARENT

| *Key*	| *Comment* |
| name	 | The topic from which this was created, %HOMETOPIC% if done from =Go=, othewise topic where =?= or form used.  Normally just topic, but is full web.topic format if parent is in a different Web.  Renaming a Web will then only break a few of these references or they can be scanned and fixed. |

---+++ META:FILEATTACHMENT

| *Key*	| *Comment* |
| name	 | Name of file, no path.  Must be unique within topic |
| version | Same as RCS revision  |
| path	 | Full path file was loaded from |
| size	 | In bytes |
| date	 | integer, unx time, seconds since start 1970 |
| user	 | the REMOTE_USER, not <nop>WikiName |
| comment | As supplied when file uploaded |
| attr	 | =h= if hidden, optional |

Extra fields that are added if an attachment is moved:

| *Key*	| *Comment* |
| movedfrom | full topic name - web.topic |
| movedby	| the REMOTE_USER, not <nop>WikiName |
| movedto	| full topic name - web.topic |
| moveddate | integer, unx time, seconds since start 1970 |

---+++ META:FORM

| *Key*	| *Comment* |
| name	 | A topic name - the topic represents one of the TWikiForms.  Can optionally include the web name (i.e., web.topic), but doesn't normally |

---+++ META:FIELD

Should only be present if there is a META:FORM entry.  Note that this data is used when viewing a topic, the form template definition is not read.

| *Key*	| *Name*	|
| name	 | Ties to entry in TWikiForms template, is title with all bar alphanumerics and . removed |
| title	| Full text from TWikiForms template |
| value	| Value user has supplied via form |

---+++ Recommended Sequence

There is no absolute need for Meta Data variables to be listed in a specific order within a topic, but it makes sense to do so a couple of good reasons:

	* form fields remain in the order they are defined
	* the =diff= function output appears in a logical order

The recommended sequence is:

	* META:TOPICINFO
	* =text of topic=
	* META:TOPICMOVED (optional)
	* META:TOPICPARENT (optional)
	* META:FILEATTACHMENT (0 or more entries)
	* META:FORM (optional)
	* META:FIELD (0 or more entries; FORM required)

---++ Viewing Meta Data in Page Source

When viewing a topic the ==Raw Text== link can be clicked to show the text of a topic (i.e., as seen when editing).  This is done by adding <code>raw=on</code> to URL.  <code>raw=debug</code> shows the meta data as well as the topic data, ex: <a href="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?raw=debug">debug view for this topic</a>

#MetaDataRendering
---++ Rendering Meta Data

Meta Data is rendered with the %<nop>META% variable. This is mostly used in the =view=, =preview= and =edit= scripts.

__Note:__ Rendering meta data is currently not supported in topic text. As a workaround, use FormattedSearch on the current topic only to render form fields.

Current support covers:

| *Variable usage:*	| *Comment:*  |
| =%<nop>META{"form"}%= | Show form data, see TWikiForms. |
| =%<nop>META{"formfield"}%= | Show form field value. Parameter: ==name="field_name"==. Example:%BR% =%<nop>META{ "formfield" name="TopicClassification" }%= |
| =%<nop>META{"attachments"}%= | Show attachments, except for hidden ones. Options: <br > \
	 ==all="on"==: Show all attachments, including hidden ones. |
| =%<nop>META{"moved"}%= | Details of any topic moves. |
| =%<nop>META{"parent"}%= | Show topic parent. Options: <br /> \
	 ==dontrecurse="on"==: By default recurses up tree, at some cost. <br /> \
	 ==nowebhome="on"==: Suppress <nop>%HOMETOPIC%. <br /> \
	 ==prefix="..."==: Prefix for parents, only if there are parents, default =""=. <br /> \
	 ==suffix="..."==: Suffix, only appears if there are parents, default =""=. <br /> \
	 ==separator="..."==: Separator between parents, default is =" &gt; "=. |

---++ Known Issues

At present, there is no Meta Data support for Plugins. However, the format is readily extendable and the =Meta.pm= code that supports the format needs only minor alteration.
