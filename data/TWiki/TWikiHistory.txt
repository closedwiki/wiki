	* Main.PeterThoeny - 28 Jul 1998: Added TWiki variables, enclosed in % signs: =%<nop>TOPIC%= (Topic name), =%<nop>WEB%= (web name), =%<nop>SCRIPTURL%= (script URL), =%<nop>DATE%= (current date), =%<nop>WIKIWEBMASTER%= (Wiki webmaster address), =%<nop>WIKIVERSION%= (Wiki version), =%<nop>USERNAME%= (user name), =%<nop>WIKIUSERNAME%= (Wiki user name).
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 31 Jul 1998: Support for quoted text with a '>' at the beginning of the line.
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 04 Aug 1998: Warn user if new topic name is not a valid Wiki name. (template file templates/Web/notwiki.tmpl)

	* Main.PeterThoeny - 14 Oct 1998: Refered-By: Find out which topics have a link to the current topic. Each topic has a |Ref-By| link for that. Note: Only references from the current web are shown, not references from other webs.
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 26 Oct 1998: Added revision control using RCS. Each topic has now a list of revisions at the bottom and a revision info, e.g. <br> <code> Topic <nop>TWikiHistory . { Edit | Ref-By | r1.3 | r1.2 | r1.1 } <br> Revision r1.3: 1998/10/26 01:34:00 by PeterThoeny </code>

	* Main.PeterThoeny - 10 Nov 1998: View differences between topic revisions. Each topic has a list of revisions (e.g. <code>r1.3</code>) and differences thereof (e.g. <code>&gt;</code>) at the bottom: <br> <code> Topic <nop>TWikiHistory . { Edit | Ref-By | r1.3 | > | r1.2 | > | r1.1 } <br> Revision r1.3: 1998/11/10 01:34 by PeterThoeny </code>
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 10 Nov 1998: The email notification and the Changes topic have now a topic date that is linked. Clicking on the link will show the difference between the two most recent topic revisions.
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 18 Nov 1998: Internal log of topic save actions to the file <code>data/logYYYYMM.txt</code>, where <code>YYYYMM</code> the year and month in numeric format is. Intended for auditing only, not accessible from the web.
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 07 Dec 1998: Possible to add a category table to a TWiki topic. This permits storing and searching for more structured information. Editing a topic shows a HTML form with the usual text area and a table with selectors, checkboxes, radio buttons and text fields. TWikiDocumentation has more on setup. The TWiki.Know web uses this category table to set classification, platform and OS version. 
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 08 Dec 1998: Signature is shown below the text area when editing a topic. Use this to easily copy & paste your signature into the text.
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 04 Jan 1999: Fixed bug when viewing differences between topic revisions that include HTML table tags like &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;td&gt;.
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 03 Feb 1999: Possible to view complete revision history of a topic on one page. Access at the linked date in the Changes page, or the <code>Diffs</code> link at the bottom of each topic, e.g. <br> <code> Topic <nop>TWikiHistory . { Edit | Ref-By | Diffs | r1.3 | > | r1.2 | > | r1.1 } <br> Revision r1.3: 1998/11/10 01:34 by <nop>PeterThoeny </code>

	* Main.PeterThoeny - 09 Feb 1999: New text formatting rule for creating =fixed font text= . Words get showns in =fixed font= by enclosing them in "=" equal signs. Example: Writing <nop>=fixed font=<nop> will show up as =fixed font= .

	* Main.PeterThoeny - 15 Apr 1999: Topic locking: Warn user if a topic has been edited by an _other_ person within _one_ hour. This is to prevent contention, e.g. simultaneous topic updates.
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 20 May 1999: New variables =%<nop>WIKIHOMEURL%= (link when pressing the icon on the upper left corner) and =%<nop>WIKITOOLNAME%= (the name of the wiki tool: =%WIKITOOLNAME%= ).
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 20 May 1999: Added meta tag so that robots index only /view/ of topics, not /edit/, /attach/ e.t.c. Tag: &lt;META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX"&gt;

	* Main.PeterThoeny - 23 Jun 1999: Separate wiki.pm into configuration (wikicfg.pm) and TWiki core (wiki.pm) . This is to ease the upgrade of TWiki installations, it also allows customized extensions to TWiki without affecting the TWiki core.

	* Main.ChristopheVermeulen - 07 Jul 1999: Link a plural topic to a singular topic in case the plural topic does not exist. Example: =TestVersion= / =TestVersions= , =TestPolicy= / =TestPolicies= , =TestAddress= / =TestAddresses= , =TestBox= / =TestBoxes= .
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 15 Jul 1999: Search path for include files in =%<nop>INCLUDE:"file.inc"%= variable. Search first in the current web, then in parent data directory. Useful to overload default include text in the data directory by web-specific text, like for example =webcopyright.inc= text.
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 21 Jul 1999: Flag =$doRemovePortNumber= in wikicfg.pm to optionally remove the port number from the TWiki URL. Example: =www.some.domain:1234/twiki= gets =www.some.domain/twiki= .

	  | This | is | a table | with | cells |
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 31 Aug 1999: Fixed Y2K bug. (Date in year 2000 had wrong format.)
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 03 Oct 1999: Limit the number of revisions shown at the bottom of the topic. Example: <br> Topic <nop>%TOPIC% . { ..... | <A href="../../rdiff/%WEB%/%TOPIC%">Diffs</A> | r1.10 | <A href="../../rdiff/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?rev1=1.10&rev2=1.9">&gt;</A> | <A href="../../view/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?rev=1.9">r1.9</A> | <A href="../../rdiff/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?rev1=1.9&rev2=1.8">&gt;</A> | <A href="../../view/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?rev=1.8">r1.8</A> | <A href="../../rdiff/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?rev1=1.8&rev2=1.7">&gt;</A> | <A href="../../view/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?rev=1.7">r1.7</A> | <A href="../../oops/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?template=oopsrev&param1=1.10">&gt;...</A> } <br> Additional revisions can be selected by pressing the =>...= link. 
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 10 Jan 2000: No more escaping for '%' percent characters. (Number of consecutive '%' entered and displayed is identical.)
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 24 Jan 2000: Fixed bug where an email address starting with a WikiName was rendered as an internal Wiki link instead of an email address, i.e. SomeWikiName@somewhere.test .
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 29 Jan 2000: Fixed bug where TWiki would not initialize correctly under certain circumstances, i.e. when running it under mod_perl. Sub =initialize= in =wiki.pm= did not handle =$thePathInfo= correctly.
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 04 Feb 2000: Access statistics. Each web has a WebStatistics topic that shows monthy statistics with number of topic views and changes, most popular topics, and top contributors. (It needs to be enabled, TWikiDocumentation has more.)
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 07 Feb 2000: Inline search. New variable =%<nop>SEARCH{"str" ...}%= to show a search result embedded in a topic text. TWikiVariables has more on the syntax. Inline search combined with the category table feature can be used for example to create a simple bug tracking system.
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 07 Feb 2000: Changed the syntax for server side include variable from =%<nop>INCLUDE:"filename.ext"%= to =%<nop>INCLUDE{"filename.ext"}%= . (Previous syntax still supported. Change was done because of inline search syntax)
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 11 Feb 2000: New variable =%<nop>SCRIPTURLPATH%= / $scriptUrlPath containing the script URL without the domain name. Templates have been changed to use this variable instead of =%<nop>SCRIPTURL%= . This is for performance reasons.
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 11 Feb 2000: New variable =%<nop>SCRIPTSUFFIX%= / $scriptSuffix containing an optional file extension of the TWiki Perl script. Templates have been changed to use this variable. This allows you to rename the Perl script files to have a file extension like for example ".cgi".
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 25 Feb 2000: Edit preferences topics to set TWiki variables. There are three level of preferences: Site-level (TWikiPreferences), web-level (WebPreferences in each web) and user-level (for each of the TWikiUsers). With this, discontinue use of server side include of =wikiwebs.inc= , =wikiwebtable.inc= , =weblist.inc= , =webcopyright.inc= and =webcolors.inc= files. 
	* Main.PeterThoeny - 25 Feb 2000: New preference variables =%<nop>EDITBOXWIDTH%= and =%<nop>EDITBOXWIDTH%= to specify the edit box size.
