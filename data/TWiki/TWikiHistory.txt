	* PeterThoeny &#149; 07 Feb 2000 &#149; Inline search. New variable =%<nop>SEARCH{"str" ...}%= to show a search result embedded in a topic text. TWikiVariables has more on the syntax. Inline search combined with the category table feature can be used for example to create a simple bug tracking system. 
	* PeterThoeny &#149; 04 Feb 2000 &#149; Access statistics. Each web has a WebStatistics topic that shows monthy statistics with number of topic views and changes, most popular topics, and top contributors. (It needs to be enabled, TWikiDocumentation has more.) 
	* PeterThoeny &#149; 29 Jan 2000 &#149; Fixed bug where TWiki would not initialize correctly under certain circumstances, i.e. when running it under mod_perl. Sub =initialize= in =wiki.pm= did not handle =$thePathInfo= correctly. 
	* PeterThoeny &#149; 24 Jan 2000 &#149; Fixed bug where an email address starting with a WikiName was rendered as an internal Wiki link instead of an email address, i.e. SomeWikiName@somewhere.test . 
	* PeterThoeny &#149; 10 Jan 2000 &#149; No more escaping for '%' percent characters. (Number of consecutive '%' entered and displayed is identical.)
