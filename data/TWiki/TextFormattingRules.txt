---# TWiki Text Formatting

Working in TWiki is as easy as typing in text. You don't need to know HTML, though you can use it if you prefer. Links to topics are created automatically when you enter WikiWords. And TWiki shorthand gives you all the power of HTML with a simple coding system that takes no time to learn. It's all laid out below.

 *Headings:* %BR%

You can create a table of contents with the [[TWikiVariables#VarTOC][%<nop>TOC%]] variable. If you want to *exclude* a heading from the TOC, put =!!= after the =---+=.

%X% Empty headings are allowed, but won't appear in the table of contents.

---++ Using HTML

You can use just about any HTML tag without a problem. You can add HTML if there is no TWiki equivalent, for example, write =&lt;strike&gt;deleted text&lt;/strike&gt;= to get <strike>deleted text</strike>.

%X% There are a few usability and technical considerations to keep in mind:
   * On collaboration pages, it's better *not* to use HTML, but to use [[#TWikiShorthand][TWiki shorthand]] instead - this keeps the text uncluttered and easy to edit.
   * If you use HTML use [[http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/][XHTML 1.0 Transitional]] syntax.
   * %X% Script tags may be filtered out, at the discretion of your TWiki administrator.

Recommendations when pasting HTML from other sources:
   * Copy only text between =&lt;body&gt;= and =&lt;/body&gt;= tags.
   * Remove all empty lines. TWiki inserts =&lt;p /&gt;= paragraph tags on empty lines, which causes problems if done between HTML tags that do not allow paragraph tags, like for example between table tags.
   * Remove leading spaces. TWiki might interpret some text as lists.
   * Do not span a tag over more than one line. TWiki requires that the opening and closing angle brackets - ==&lt;...&gt;== - of an HTML tag are on the same line, or the tag will be broken.
   * In your HTML editing program, save without hard line breaks on text wrap.

%T% TWiki converts shorthand notation to HTML for display. To copy a fully marked-up page, simply view the source in your browser and save the contents. If you need to save HTML frequently, you may want to check out TWiki:Plugins/PublishAddOn.

---+++ Script tags

You can use HTML =&lt;script>= tags for your TWiki applications. However note that your TWiki administrator can disable =&lt;script>= in topics, and may have chosen to do so for security considerations. TWiki markup and TWikiVariables are *not* expanded inside script tags.

---++ Hyperlinks

Being able to create links without any special formatting is a core TWiki feature, made possible with WikiWords and inline URLs.

---+++ Internal Links

   * GoodStyle is a WikiWord that links to the <nop>GoodStyle topic located in the current web.

   * NotExistingYet is a topic waiting to be written. Create the topic by clicking on the *?*. (Try clicking, but then, *Cancel* - creating the topic would wreck this example!)

---+++ External Links

   * =http://...=, =https://...=, =ftp://...=, =gopher://...=, =news://...=, =file://...=, =telnet://...=
     and =mailto:...@...= are linked automatically.

   * E-mail addresses like =name@domain.com= are linked automatically.

   * =[<nop>[Square bracket rules]]= let you easily create [[#SquareBrackets][non-WikiWord links]].
      * You can also write =[<nop>[http://yahoo.com Yahoo home page]]= as an easier way of doing external links with descriptive text for the link, such as [[http://yahoo.com/ Yahoo home page]].

---++ TWiki Variables

TWiki Variables are names that are enclosed in percent signs =%= that are expanded on the fly.

   * =%<nop>TOC%= : Automatically generates a table of contents based on headings in a topic - see the top of this page for an example.

   * =%<nop>WEB%= : The current web, is <b><nop>%WEB%</b>.

   * =%<nop>TOPIC%= : The current topic name, is <b>%TOPIC%</b>.

   * =%<nop>ATTACHURL%= : The attachment URL of the current topic. Example usage: If you attach a file to a topic you can refer to it as =<b>%<nop>ATTACHURL%/image.gif</b>= to show the URL of the file or the image in your text.

   * =%<nop>INCLUDE{"SomeTopic"}%= : Server side include, includes another topic. The current web is the default web. Example: =<b>%<nop>INCLUDE{"%TWIKIWEB%.SiteMap"}%</b>=

   * =%<nop>SEARCH{"sushi"}%= : Inline search showing the search result embedded in a topic. FormattedSearch gives you control over formatting, useful for creating web-based applications.

   * TWikiPreferences defines some site-wide variables. Among others:
      * *Line break:* Write =%<nop>BR%= to start a new line.
      * *Colored text:* Write: =%<nop>RED% Red %<nop>ENDCOLOR% and %<nop>BLUE% blue %<nop>ENDCOLOR% colors= to get: %RED% Red %ENDCOLOR% and %BLUE% blue %ENDCOLOR% colors.
      * *Documentation Graphics:* Write: =%<nop>H% Help, %<nop>T% Tip, %<nop>X% Alert= to get: %H% Help, %T% Tip, %X% Alert. For more info see TWikiDocGraphics.

   * There are many more variables, see *[[TWikiVariables]]*.

   * To "escape" a variable, prefix it with an exclamation mark. Write: =!%<nop>SOMEVARIABLE%= to get: !%SOMEVARIABLE%.

---++ <nop>TWikiPlugin Formatting Extensions

Plugins can extend the functionality of TWiki into many other areas. There are a huge number of TWiki plugins available from the [[http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins][Plugins]] web on TWiki.org.

Currently enabled plugins on this TWiki installation, as listed by =%<nop>PLUGINDESCRIPTIONS%=:
%PLUGINDESCRIPTIONS%

Check on current Plugin status and settings for this site in TWikiPreferences.

---++ Common Editing Errors

TWiki formatting rules are fairly simple to use and quick to type. However, there are some things to watch out for, taken from the TextFormattingFAQ:

   * *Q:* Text enclosed in angle brackets like =&lt;filename&gt;= is not displayed. How can I show it as it is?
      * *A:* The ='&lt;'= and ='&gt;'= characters have a special meaning in HTML, they define HTML tags. You need to escape them, so write ='&amp;lt;'= instead of ='&lt;'=, and ='&amp;gt;'= instead of ='&gt;'=. <br /> Example: Type ='prog &amp;lt;filename&amp;gt;'= to get ='prog &lt;filename&gt;'=.

   * *Q:* Why is the ='&'= character sometimes not displayed?
      * *A:* The ='&'= character has a special meaning in HTML, it starts a so called character entity, i.e. ='&amp;copy;'= is the =&copy;= copyright character. You need to escape ='&amp;'= to see it as it is, so write ='&amp;amp;'= instead of ='&amp;'=. <br /> Example: Type ='This &amp;amp; that'= to get ='This &amp; that'=.
