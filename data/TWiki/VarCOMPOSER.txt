#VarCOMPOSER
---+++ COMPOSER -- select WYSIWYG editor


Some skins have two editors available; the default editor, and a
second editor which is usually a WYSIWYG editor (the second editor is
used by hitting the %MAKETEXT{"WYSIWYG"}% link in =pattern= or
=classic= skins). If COMPOSER is not set, the second editor will work
the same as the _default_ editor. If the !WysiwygPlugin is installed
and it is set to 'kupu' (the default), then the *Kupu* WYSIWYG editor
will be enabled. You can change the setting to use any editor that is
enabled by setting the =cover= parameter on the edit URL.
