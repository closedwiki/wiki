#VarSEARCHDEFAULTTTYPE
---+++ SEARCHDEFAULTTTYPE -- default type for search


Default type for search, one of: =keyword= (for search engine like
syntax), =regex= (for RegularExpression search), or =literal= (for
verbatim search).  Note that the variable name has three consecutive 'T'.
This is a typo and _ought_ to be fixed, but at the moment that is the
name the code is using and maybe a couple of installations have been
using it for customisation.
   * Type: Preference variable defined in [[%TWIKIWEB%.%WIKIPREFSTOPIC%]].  Can be customized for a TWiki site in [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]], and for each web in their %WEBPREFSTOPIC% topics.
   * Current value: SEARCHDEFAULTTTYPE = %SEARCHDEFAULTTTYPE%
