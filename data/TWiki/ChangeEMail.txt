%MAINWEB%.TWikiUsers has a full list of user names.

This form is used to change your registered email addresses. Your registered emails are used by TWiki for sending you emails, include notifications of password changes. The addresses you register via this form are kept secret and will *not* be published anywhere on this site.

%W% __Security Note__: You really ought to register a valid email address. If TWiki can't find a registered email for you in the secret database, it will look in your user topic for a line like this:
<verbatim>
   * Set Email = user@example.com
</verbatim>
If your user topic is not protected from changes by other people, and you don't register an email address using this form, then your user account could be hijacked by someone else.

If your old email addresses are all invalid (you can't receive mail there any more) and you have forgotten your password, please contact %WIKIWEBMASTER%.
