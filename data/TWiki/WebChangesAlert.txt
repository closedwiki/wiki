---+++ Web Changes Notification Service

Each TWiki web has an automatic e-mail notification service that sends you an e-mail with links to all of the topics modified since the last alert. 

%INCLUDE{"MailerContrib"}%

__Note for System Administrators:__ Notification is supported by an add-on to the TWiki kernel called the !MailerContrib. See the MailerContrib topic for details of how to set up this service.
