---++ Web Changes Notification Service

Each %WIKITOOLNAME% web has an automatic email notification service that sends you an email with links to all of the topics modified since the last alert. 

	* You can subscribe and unsubscribe yourself in WebNotify on each web. Changes are immediate.

	* The frequency of alerts is set by the TWiki site administrator: it could be once a day, every hour, whatever works for the particular web.
		* On TWiki.org, WebChangesAlerts are sent once a day.
