---## Monitoring Site Changes

Each %WIKITOOLNAME% web does an automatic email notification of recent changes. Users can subscribe / unsubscribe themselves in %NOTIFYTOPIC% of each TWiki web. The Perl script ==mailnotify== is called by a deamon in regular intervals. The script is sending an automated email to subscribed users in case some topics changed in a web within this interval.

---+++ Configuring Outgoing Mail

%WIKITOOLNAME% will use the ==Net::SMTP== module in case it is installed on your system. You need to specify the ==SMTPMAILHOST== variable in TWikiPreferences.

You can use an external mail program like ==sendmail== in case the ==Net::SMTP== module is not installed. In this case specify the ==$mailProgram== in ==twiki/bin/TWiki.cfg==.

---+++ Call ==mailnotify== at Regular Intervals

*For Unix platforms:* Edit the cron table so that ==mailnotify== is called in an interval of your choice. Please consult ==man crontab== of how to modify the table that schedules program execution at certain intervals. Example:
<pre>
% crontab -e
15,45 * * * * (cd ~twiki/public_html/bin; ./mailnotify -q)
</pre>
The above line will call mailnotify at 15 minutes and 45 minutes past every hour. The ==-q== switch suppresses all normal output.

On Windows NT / 2000 you can use a scheduled task.
