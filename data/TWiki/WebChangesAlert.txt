---++ Web Changes Notification Service

Each TWiki web has an automatic email notification service that sends you an email with links to all of the topics modified since the last alert. 

---+++ Subscription
You can subscribe and unsubscribe yourself in %NOTIFYTOPIC% on each web. Please keep the list in alphabetical order so that names can be found easily.

%STARTINCLUDE%
__Format:__ TWiki handles entries in bullet list (=&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;*=) format containing the WikiName of a user; a !WikiName with e-mail address; or a [[%MAINWEB%.TWikiGroups][TWikiGroup]]. Examples:

	* =%MAINWEB%.FredBloggs=
	* =%MAINWEB%.FredBloggs - <nop>secondary@home.com=
	* =%MAINWEB%.EngineeringGroup=

The first entry is the default form, the notification gets sent to the e-mail address specified in the user's home page. The second entry lists an alternative e-mail address. The third entry specifies a group, the notification gets sent to each member of the group.

%STOPINCLUDE%

---+++ E-mail Alerts

The frequency of alerts is set by the TWiki site administrator: It could be once a day, every hour, whatever works for the particular web. On TWiki.org, alerts are sent once a day.

See TWikiSiteTools for information on how to setup the alerts.
