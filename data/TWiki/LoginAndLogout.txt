---++ Background Information

TWiki.org uses BasicAuthentication with IP address based session tracking. The advantage is that there is a very low requirement on the client side. Any browser is supported, even those without cookies.

There is a drawback however. IP address based session tracking fails if people share an IP address, e.g. a whole company might expose just one IP address through a NAT. In this case TWiki.org might tell you that you are someone else in your organization.
