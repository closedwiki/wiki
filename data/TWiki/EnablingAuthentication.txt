---+ Enabling Authentication of Users

The simplest way of enabling authentication is to use the webserver to authenticate access to the scripts that TWiki uses to display and edit topics. Once the webserver is authenticating users, you can use the TWikiAccessControls to limit access to topics within TWiki.

There are also several TWiki plugins that support more flexible (and extensible) TWiki user management models. For example, see TWiki:Plugins.SessionPlugin for persistant login, and TWiki:Plugins.AuthPagePlugin for a login/logout model.

These instructions are for =mod_auth= (Basic Authentication) on the Apache webserver. You can also use other webserver authentication methods using Apache modules such as =mod_digest= and mod_auth_mysql=.

---++ Enabling Authentication Using Apache =mod_auth=

   1 TWiki supports all the most common password file (=.htpasswd=) formats. Use [[%SCRIPTURL%/configure%SCRIPTSUFFIX%#PasswordManager][configure]] to set up TWiki to create the right kind of =.htpasswd= entries.
	1 Create a =.htaccess= file in the =twiki/bin= directory.<br />%H% There is an template for this file in =twiki/bin/.htaccess.txt= that you can copy and change. The comments in the file explain what need to be done.<br />%H% If you got it right, the browser should now ask for login name and password when you click on the <u>Edit</u>. If =.htaccess= does not have the desired effect, you may need to "AllowOverride All" for the directory in =httpd.conf= (if you have root access; otherwise, email web server support)
    <br /> %X% At this time TWikiAccessControls do not control access to files in the =pub= area, unless they are only accessed through the =viewfile= script. If your =pub= directory is set up to allow open access you may want to add =.htaccess= files in there as well to restrict access 
	1 In TWiki, *edit* the TWikiRegistrationPub topic, *copy* the contents, then *edit* TWikiRegistration and *paste*, deleting the old contents and replacing them with the contents of TWikiRegistrationPub.
    <br />You can customize the registration form by deleting or adding input tags. The =name=""= parameter of the input tags must start with: ="Twk0..."= (if this is an optional entry), or ="Twk1..."= (if this is a required entry). This ensures that the fields are carried over into the user home page correctly.
    <br />You can customize the default user home page in NewUserTemplate. The same variables get expanded as in the [[TWikiTemplates#Template_Topics][template topics]]
	1 Register yourself in the TWikiRegistration topic.
    <br /> %H% Check that a new line with the username and encrypted password is added to the =.htpasswd= file. If not, you may have got a path wrong, or the permissions may not allow the webserver user to write to that file.
	1 Create a new topic to check if authentication works.
	1 *Edit the %MAINWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup topic in the TWiki:%MAINWEB% web to include users with system administrator status.*
    <br /> %X% *This is a very important step*, as users in this group can access _all_ topics, independent of TWiki access controls.
TWikiAccessControl has more information on setting up access controls.
