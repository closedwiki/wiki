---++ TWiki Tags

TWiki tags are, in essence, lightweight plugins. 

One of the key additions to Dakar plugins was the ability to register a function associated with a tag. Unfortunately, full-blown plugins have a cost associated with them whether they are used or not, because an object is created and the existence of each possible =handler= is checked for callback purposes.  !TWikiTags, on the other hands, have no callbacks, are compiled when TWiki.pm is loaded (during the =BEGIN= block) and are no more expensive to use than TWikiVariables (many of which probably should be moved into !TWikiTags that are enabled by default).

Moving TWikiVariables out of =TWiki.pm= into tags probably won't make things any faster. There will be two benefits of doing this, however. First, it isolates the code for a particular !TWikiVariable, making it easier to maintain and enhance. Second, it allows for alternate implementations of the same tag.

There are still details to be worked out, such as making !TWikiTags self-documenting. But they work, are supported by =bin/configure= and =create-new-plugin.pl=, so the basics are all there.
