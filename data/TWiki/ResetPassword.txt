If you didn't forget your password, use ChangePassword to change it to a new one. Otherwise, use this form to get a new one emailed to you. Your LoginName is listed on %MAINWEB%.TWikiUsers.

<form name="passwd" action="%SCRIPTURL%/passwd%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%MAINWEB%/%HOMETOPIC%" method="post">
|  Your %TWIKIWEB%.LoginName: | <input type="text" name="LoginName" value="%URLPARAM{username}%" size="40" /> =<font color="red">**</font>= |
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="resetPassword">
<input type="hidden" name="TopicName" value="%TOPIC%" /> <input type="submit" value=" Request password reset " />
</form>

After submitting this form, you will receive an email with your new, *system-generated* password, and a link to a page where you can change it.

If you continue to have problems, please email %WIKIWEBMASTER% for help.

__Note to administrator:__ The reset password form applies only if TWiki uses Basic Authentication, e.g. a =.htpasswd= file managed by TWiki. It does not apply if you are using external authentication, such as an IT managed password system. (remove this note if you are using Basic Authentication; replace this topic with a note describing how to reset the password in your organization)
