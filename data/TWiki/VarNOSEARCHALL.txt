#VarNOSEARCHALL
---+++ NOSEARCHALL -- exclude a web from a =web=all= search *deprecated*

If set to =on= in a web's [[%WEBPREFSTOPIC%]], this web is excluded
from a search with a =web=all= attribute.
This variable is not intended to be expanded in any topic.

__Note:__ it is much better to use TWikiAccessControls in individual webs to control who can and can't view the contents of a web. NOSEARCHALL is retained for compatibility, but you should avoid using it.

   * Usage: Evaluated by TWiki and not intended to be expanded in any topic.
   * Type: Preference variable defined in [[%TWIKIWEB%.%WIKIPREFSTOPIC%]].  Can be customized for a TWiki site in [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]], and for each web in their %WEBPREFSTOPIC% topics.
