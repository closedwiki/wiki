---+ TWiki Pages

%TOC%

Each page in a TWiki web is called a __topic__, defined by its meaningful, descriptive %TWIKIWEB%.WikiWord title. 

---++ Page Features

A TWiki topic is a self-contained information unit rich in features:

	* a WikiWord title that lets you:
		* instantly identify what the page is about
		* automatically link to it from other pages
	* an edit-anywhere collaboration area where you can:
		* enter plain or fully-HTML formatted text
		* work with simple TWiki editing shorthand (that includes HTML mark-up and special TWiki functions)
		* include Web links, images, anything else you can put on a Web page
	* an extra [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiForms][forms input]] option:
		* store structured info alongside the free-form page content
		* use text fields and boxes, radio buttons, pulldown selector menus, checkboxes
		* select from one or many different input forms, with all data preserved
	* a FileAttachment feature that lets you:
		* upload files through your browser to the TWiki server
		* attach any type of file (documents, images, applications) for viewing or downloading
		* make changes and update existing files
	* [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiSkins][TWiki Skins]] to customize the look of headers and footers:
		* apply skins across an entire TWiki web level, or to a single page
	* browser-based controls for [[#RenamingTopics][renaming, moving, and deleting]] pages:
		* rename a page and automatically update all the references to it, site-wide
		* move a page from one TWiki web to another
		* safely delete a topic to a special Trash web (invisible, but accessible to the TWiki administrators if needed)
	* flexible [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiAccessControl][access control]]:
		* independently determine who can see, edit, rename, move or delete topics
		* set permissions by individual users and user groups
	* revision control automatically saves topic changes:
		* uses the established standard RCS (Revision Control System)
		* efficiently stores every change made to the original version
		* allows comparison of changes between any two versions, and review of any version, as formatted or raw text
	* referred-by searches that list all topics in a web or site wide that link to a particular page
	* hierarchical parent-child topic navigation:
		* automatically links a new page as the "child" of the page it was created from
		* allows manual assignment of parent page from a list of all topics in the local web
		* offers navigation displays, by topic parent, or by related topic 
 
The configuration of your TWiki site and your own user account determine which of these features you can use.

#EditingPages
---++ How to create and edit a page

Adding and editing information on existing pages, and creating new pages, is TWiki's main function.

	* To modify a topic, click the ==[Edit]== link at the bottom left of every page. An editing window appears. Type away. Use the GoodStyle and TextFormattingRules links to get pop-up window help.
		* Click ==[Preview Changes]== to see how your edit looks.
		* Click ==[Save Changes]== to save.

	* To add a new page, the simplest way is to type a new WikiName on an existing page. When the page is saved, the new name will appear highlighted, with a *?* at the end: click the *?* and a new edit window appears. Enter, preview and save as usual. The new page now exists.

#OtherFeatures
---++ How to attach files and use other features

The color-coded control strip at the bottom of every page displays a series of links, including ==[Attach]== (for attachments), ==[Ref-by]== (to display referring pages), and ==[More]==, which opens a new screen of additional controls). 

	* Most controls are self-explanatory, and also include explanatory text and help links.
	* Experiment. You can always cancel or go Back whenever you like.
	* Get in-depth info from the [[%TWIKIWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%][complete documentation]], including the User's Guide and Reference Manual.

#RenamingTopics
---++ How to rename, move or delete a page

You can now rename, move and delete individual topics from your browser. All three options are available by clicking *More* on the control strip at the bottom of every page. The access settings for a topic, web or entire site may be disabled for one or more of the three options. In any case, all three are similar and extremely self-explanatory.

	1. On the topic you want to change, click *More* &gt; *Rename/move*
	1. To move or delete: select the target web (=Trash= for delete)from the pull-down menu; otherwise, leave on the current web
	1. To rename: fill in a new WikiName (otherwise, leave the current topic name)
	1. To update occurrences of the topic name on other pages: From the list of pages that link to the topic, check or uncheck each entry as you desire - only checked links will be updated;
	1. Click *Rename/move*: the topic will be renamed and links to the topic updated.
		* Any problems are listed ; you can change them later.
		* If a referring page can't be update because it's locked (ex: someone's editing), it appears on an alert. You can missed pages later by again pressing *Rename/move*.

%H% Deleting means moving the topic to the Trash web. Since all webs share the one Trash, name conflicts may come up. 

%X% *NOTE:* Keep in mind that moving a topic from a view-restricted web to a public web or the Trash web will compromise security.
