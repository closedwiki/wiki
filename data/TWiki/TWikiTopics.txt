---+ TWiki Pages

%TOC%

Each page in a TWiki web is called a __topic__, defined by its meaningful, descriptive %TWIKIWEB%.WikiWord title. 

---++ Page Features

A TWiki topic is a self-contained information unit, rich in features that include:

	* a WikiWord title that lets you:
		* instantly identify what the page is about
		* autolink to it from other pages simply by typing it in
	* an edit-anywhere collaboration area where you can:
		* enter plain or HTML-formatted text
		* work with simple TWikiShorthand (the power of HTML plus special TWiki tags)
		* include links, images, anything else you can put on a regular Web page
	* an optional [[TWikiDocumentation#TWiki_Form_Templates][form]] feature to:
		* store structured info along with the freeform page content
		* use text fields and boxes, radio buttons, pulldown selector menus, checkboxes
		* select the right input template for each page from a choice of multiple form
	* a FileAttachment function that allows you to:
		* upload files through your browser to the TWiki server
		* attach any size and type of file (documents, images, applications) for viewing or downloading
		* make changes and update existing files
	* [[TWikiDocumentation#TWiki_Skins][TWiki Skins]] that work on the web level, but can also be used to customize the look of headers and footers on a single page
	* browser-based controls for [[#RenamingTopics][renaming, moving, and deleting]] pages:
		* rename a page and automatically update all the links referring to it, site-wide
		* move a page from one TWiki web to another
		* safely delete a topic to a special Trash web (invisible, but accessible to the TWiki administrators if needed)
	* flexible [[TWikiDocumentation#TWiki_Access_Control][access control]]:
		* independently determine who can view, edit, rename, move or delete topics
		* set permissions by individual users and user groups

The configuration of your TWiki site and your own user account determine which of these features you can use.

#RenamingTopics
---++ How to rename, move or delete a page

You can now rename, move and delete individual topics from your browser. All three options are available by clicking *More* on the control strip at the bottom of every page. Access to one or more of these three options, for a topic, a web or an entire site, may be available to administrators only. In any case, all three are similar and extremely self-explanatory.

	1. On the page you want to change, click *More* &gt; *Rename/move*
	1. To move or delete: select the target web (=Trash= for delete)from the pull-down menu; otherwise, leave on the current web
	1. To rename: fill in a new WikiName (otherwise, leave the current topic name)
	1. To update occurrences of the topic name on other pages: From the list of pages that link to the topic, check or uncheck each entry as you desire - only checked links will be updated;
	1. Click *Rename/move*: the topic will be renamed and links to the topic updated.
		* Any problems are listed; you can change them later.
		* If a referring page can't be update because it's locked (ex: someone is editing), it appears on an alert. You can update missed pages later by again pressing *Rename/move*.

%H% Deleting means moving the topic to the Trash web. Since all webs share the one Trash, name conflicts may come up. 

%X% *NOTE:* Keep in mind that moving a topic from a view-restricted web to a public web or the Trash web will compromise security.

See [[TWikiDocumentation#Managing_Topics][ManagingTopics]] for more details.
