---+ TWiki Pages

%TOC%

Each page in a TWiki web is called a __topic__, defined by its meaningful, descriptive %TWIKIWEB%.WikiWord title. 

---++ Page Features

A TWiki topic is a self-contained information unit rich in features:

	* a WikiWord title that lets you:
		* instantly identify what the page is about
		* automatically link to it from other pages
	* an edit-anywhere collaboration area where you can:
		* enter plain or fully-HTML formatted text
		* work with simple TWiki editing shorthand (that includes HTML mark-up and special TWiki functions)
		* include Web links, images, anything else you can put on a Web page
	* an extra [[TWikiDocumentation#TWiki_Form_Templates][forms input]] option:
		* store structured info alongside the free-form page content
		* use text fields and boxes, radio buttons, pulldown selector menus, checkboxes
		* select from one or many different input forms, with all data preserved
	* a FileAttachment feature that lets you:
		* upload files through your browser to the TWiki server
		* attach any type of file (documents, images, applications) for viewing or downloading
		* make changes and update existing files
	* [[TWikiDocumentation#TWiki_Skins][TWiki Skins]] work on the web level, but can also be used to customize the look of headers and footers on a single pages
	* browser-based controls for [[#RenamingTopics][renaming, moving, and deleting]] pages:
		* rename a page and automatically update all the references to it, site-wide
		* move a page from one TWiki web to another
		* safely delete a topic to a special Trash web (invisible, but accessible to the TWiki administrators if needed)
	* flexible [[TWikiDocumentation#TWiki_Access_Control][access control]]:
		* independently determine who can see, edit, rename, move or delete topics
		* set permissions by individual users and user groups

Depending on the set-up of your TWiki site and your own user account, you have several or all of the above.

#RenamingTopics
---++ How to rename, move or delete a page

You can now rename, move and delete individual topics from your browser. All three options are available by clicking *More* on the control strip at the bottom of every page. The access settings for a topic, web or entire site may be disabled for one or more of the three options. In any case, all three are similar and extremely self-explanatory.

	1. On the topic you want to change, click *More* &gt; *Rename/move*
	1. To move or delete: select the target web (=Trash= for delete)from the pull-down menu; otherwise, leave on the current web
	1. To rename: fill in a new WikiName (otherwise, leave the current topic name)
	1. To update occurrences of the topic name on other pages: From the list of pages that link to the topic, check or uncheck each entry as you desire - only checked links will be updated;
	1. Click *Rename/move*: the topic will be renamed and links to the topic updated.
		* Any problems are listed ; you can change them later.
		* If a referring page can't be update because it's locked (ex: someone's editing), it appears on an alert. You can missed pages later by again pressing *Rename/move*.

*Note:* Deleting means moving the topic to the Trash web. Since all webs share the one Trash, name conflicts may come up. 

*Note:* Keep in mind that moving a topic from a view restricted web to a public web or the Trash web will compromize security.
