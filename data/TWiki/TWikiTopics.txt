---++ How to rename, move, or delete a topic

You can now rename, move and delete individual topics from your browser. All three options are available by clicking the [Rename/Move] on the lower toolbar. The access settings for a particular page, web or entire site may disable one or more of the three options. In any case, all three are similar and extremely self-explanatory on-screen.

	1 On the topic you want to change, click *Rename/move*
	1 To move or delete, from the pull-down menu, select the target web ("Trash" for delete); otherwise, leave on the current web
	2 To rename, fill in new WikiName, or leave the default current topic anme
	3 You will be warned if there are locks or if there is a name clash - adjust accordingly, or [Cancel]
	4 A list of pages that link to the topic will be listed, checked by default: checked links will be updated; clear the checkbox to prevent any unwanted changes
	5 Click [Rename/Move]: the topic will be renamed and links to the topic updated.
		* If any of the referring pages are locked then they will be listed. You can correct these later by again pressing Rename/Move.

*Note:* Deleting means moving the topic to the Trash web. Since all webs share the one Trash, name conflicts may come up.

See ManagingTopics for more details.
