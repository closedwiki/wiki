To upgrade an earlier TWiki version like =01 Sep 1999= to version =01 May 2000= you should do the following things:

	* Back up your system.
	* Update the templates in the =/templates= directory (and its subdirs):
		* Take the templates of the latest distribution as the base and merge your changes back into it.
	* Update the Perl scripts in the =/bin= directory:
		* Take the scripts of the latest distribution as the base and merge your changes back into it. Do so also for =wikicfg.pm= because it has important changes as well.
	* Update topics:
		* Copy the new Main. Main.TWikiPreferences topic (and =*,v= file) into your TWiki.Main web. Customize the topic to your needs.
		* Copy the new Main. Main.WebPreferences, Main.WebStatistics topics (and =*,v= files) into all your webs. Customize all WebPreferences topics to your needs (e.g. web color).
		* Copy WebSearch into all your webs, or modify the existing ones. __Reason:__ Some switches for search changed.
		* Copy the TWiki documentation into your Main web: Topics TWikiDocumentation, TWikiUsernameVsLoginUsername, TWikiVariables, WebNotification, TWikiCategoryTable, TWikiImplementationNotes, TWikiInstallationGuide, TWikiUpgradeTo01May2000, TextFormattingRules, TWikiHistory .
		* Copy the registration topic into your Main web:
			* In case you are on an Intranet: Copy topic TWikiRegistration to Main.<nop>TWikiRegistration. Customize if needed.
			* In case you are on a public server: Copy topic <nop>TWikiRegistrationPub to Main.<nop>TWikiRegistration. Customize if needed.
		* Copy the Main. TWikiWebsTable topic (and =*,v= file) into your Main web and customize it. __Reason:__ The new release does not use the =*.inc= include files anymore.
		* Optionally: Search for =%<nop>INCLUDE%'s= in all your webs and change them to the new =%<nop>INCLUDE{"file.ext"}%= syntax. __Note:__ Your old =%<nop>INCLUDE:"file.ext"%= syntax still works (the legacy rule is defined in =wikicfg.pm= .) 
	* Add the <a href="http://TWiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Main/PoweredByTWikiLogo">PoweredByTWikiLogo</a> to your %WIKITOOLNAME% home page.
