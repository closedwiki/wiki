	* For Unix or Linux, check TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnUnix and TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnLinux.
	* For Windows, check the WindowsInstallCookbook. 
	* For <nop>MacOS X, check TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnMacOSX. 
	* To install TWiki on <nop>SourceForge, for use on a software development project, read TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnSourceForge
	* For other platforms, see TWiki:Codev/TWikiOn, and search the TWiki:Codev and TWiki:Support webs for other installation notes.

#StandardInstallation
---+ Basic Installation

   1 *Download* the TWiki distribution from http://TWiki.org/download.html.
   1 *Unpack the distribution* where you want to install it.
   1 *Make sure* the user that runs CGI scripts on your system can read and write all files in the distribution.
   1 *Make sure* Perl 5 and the Perl CGI library are installed on your system. 
     <br />The default location of Perl is =/usr/bin/perl=. *If it's somewhere else*, change the path to Perl in the first line of each script in the =twiki/bin= directory.
     <br />%H% Some systems require a special extension on perl scripts (e.g. =.cgi= or =.pl=). If necessary, rename all files in =twiki/bin=  (i.e. rename =view= to =view.pl= etc). If you do this, make sure you set the =ScriptSuffix= option in =configure= (Step 6).
   1 *Create the file* =/twiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg=.
     <br /> There is a template for this file in =/twiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg.txt=. <br /> The file must contain a setting for =$twikiLibPath=, which must point to the absolute file path of your =twiki/lib= e.g. =/home/httpd/twiki/lib=.
     <br />%H% If you need to install additional CPAN modules, but can't update the main Perl installation files on the server, you can set =$CPANBASE= to point to your personal CPAN install. Don't forget that the webserver user has to be able to read those files as well.
   1 *Configure the webserver* so you can execute the =bin/configure= script from your browser.<br /> Run the =configure= script from your browser, and resolve any errors or warnings it tells you about.
You now have a basic, unauthenticated installation running. At this point you can just point your Web browser at =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/view= and start TWiki-ing away!

#AuthenticationOfUsers
---+ Next Steps (optional)
Once you have your TWiki running, you can move on to customise it for your users.
   * *Edit the TWikiPreferences topic* in the %TWIKIWEB% web. Read through it and set any additional settings you think you might need (you can click the 'Edit' button near the top to edit the settings in place)
      * %I% Alternately, you can *copy* any settings or variables that you want to customize from [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPreferences]] and *paste* them into [[%MAINWEB%.TWikiPreferences]]. This will protect your local customizations from being overwritten in later upgrades. See notes at top of [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPreferences]] for more information.
   * *Enable authentication*, if required. Read TWikiUserAuthentication..
   * *Enable email notification* (WebChangesAlerts). Read TWikiSiteTools.
   * *Install Plugins*. TWiki:Plugins is an extensive library of Plugins for TWiki, that enhance functionality in a huge number of ways. A few plugins are pre-installed in the TWiki distribution. Installation instructions for the other plugins can be found in the plugin topics on [[TWiki:Plugins][TWiki.org]].

---+ Troubleshooting
The first step is to re-run the =configure= script and make sure you have resolved all errors, and are happy that you understand any warnings.
