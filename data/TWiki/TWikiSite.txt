---++ TWiki is a Web-based collaboration tool

	* A TWiki site is a simple, satisfying, full-featured open communication environment:
		* people anywhere online can meet
		* rich Web text, images, online multimedia are easily shared
		* documents and other files can be uploaded and downloaded
		* everything works through a regular Web browser

---+++ TWiki is written in Perl...

	* TWiki's parsing engine reads a text file, hyperlinks it, and converts TWiki shorthand into standard HTML, on the fly. The point is to:
		* make editing text extremely simple (to see how simple, click on the *Edit* link at the bottom of the page) 
		* let you find information fast ([[WebSearch][WebSearch]]). 

	* In addition to being quick, as a meeting and colloboration space, %WIKITOOLNAME% aspires to the Zen ideals known as WabiSabi. Zen finds beauty in the imperfect and ephemeral. When it comes down to it, that's all you need.

	* %WIKITOOLNAME% is one of many WikiWikiClones, based on the original [[http://c2.com/][Wiki Wiki Web]], built by Wiki:WardCummingham.

---+++ "TWiki" stands for...

	* _Wiki wiki_ means "quick" in Hawaiian. The shuttle at Honolulu Airport is called the _wiki wiki_ bus, which is where the original Wiki web got its name.
	* _TWiki_ is short for _TakeFive Wiki_. (It was later discovered that _Twiki_ is also the name of an AI robot that co-starred in the <a href="http://www.buck-rogers.com/" target="_blank"><i>Buck Rogers...</i></a> movie and TV show from 1979 - its head is in the logo.)
