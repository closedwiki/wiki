---++ TWiki is a Web-based collaboration platform

	* A TWiki site is a easy-to-use, full-featured open communication environment:
		* people anywhere on the Web or on an intranet can meet
		* rich Web text, images, and online multimedia are easily shared
		* documents and other files can be uploaded and downloaded
		* everything works through a regular Web browser

---+++ TWiki is a powerful Web enhancement...

	* TWiki's parsing engine is written in Perl. It reads a text file, and converts TWiki shorthand into standard HTML, on the fly. The point is to:
		* make adding and editing text simple _(How simple? Click on the *Edit* link at the bottom of the page...)_ 
		* let you find information _fast_ ([[WebSearch][WebSearch]])

	* TWiki provides an intuitive way to meet and collaborate, that aspires to the Zen ideals known as WabiSabi. It finds beauty in the imperfect and ephemeral and constantly evolving. When it comes down to it, that's all you need.

	* TWiki is one of many WikiWikiClones, based on Ward Cunningham's original [[http://c2.com/][Wiki Wiki Web]].

---+++ "TWiki" stands for...

	* _Wiki wiki_ means "quick" in Hawaiian. The shuttle at Honolulu Airport is called the _wiki wiki_ bus, which is where the original Wiki web got its name.
	* _TWiki_ is short for _TakeFive Wiki_ from the name of the company where its founder worked. (It was later discovered that _Twiki_ is also the name of an AI robot that co-starred in the <a href="http://www.buck-rogers.com/" target="_blank"><i>Buck Rogers...</i></a> movie and TV show from 1979 - its head is in the logo.)

---+++ Selected TWiki Topics...
	* TWikiPages tells you how to do administrative things, like renaming topics.
	* TWikiHistory timelines TWiki's development.
	* TWikiPlannedFeatures lists of approved additions to future TWiki versions.
	* TWikiEnhancementRequests is the place to add your new feature requests.
