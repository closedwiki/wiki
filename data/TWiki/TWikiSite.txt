---++ TWiki is a Web-based collaboration tool

	* A TWiki site is an easy-to-use, satisfying open communication environment where...
		* people anywhere on the Internet can meet,
		* share rich Web text, images, online multimedia,
		* do it all through a regular Web browser. 

---+++ TWiki is written in Perl...

TWiki's parsing engine reads a text file, hyperlinks it, and converts it to standard HTML, on the fly. The point is to:
	* make editing text extremely simple (to see how simple, click on *Edit* link at the bottom of the page) 
	* and to let you find information fast ([[WebSearch][WebSearch]]). 

In addition to being quick, %WIKITOOLNAME% aspires to the Zen ideals known as WabiSabi. Zen finds beauty in the imperfect and ephemeral. When it comes down to it, that's all you need.

%WIKITOOLNAME% is one of many WikiWikiClones; the first Wiki was built by Wiki:WardCummingham, http://c2.com/.

---+++ "TWiki" stands for...

	* _Wiki wiki_ means "quick" in Hawaiian. They call the shuttle at Honolulu Airport the wiki wiki bus. Which is where the original Wiki Wiki Web got its name.
	* _TWiki_ is short for _TakeFive Wiki_ . (It was later found that _Twiki_ is the name of a robot in a <a href="http://www.buck-rogers.com/" target="_blank">Buck Rogers</a> TV show from 1979. That's his head.)
