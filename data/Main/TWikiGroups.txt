These groups can be used to define fine grained %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiAccessControl in %WIKITOOLNAME%:

	* TWikiAdminGroup
	* EngineeringGroup
	* SupportGroup
	* 

Add your groups to this list and define new group topics similar to existing ones. Group topics __must__ end in =...Group.=

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* Think twice before restricting write access to a web or a topic, because an open system where everybody can contribute is the essence of the %TWIKIWEB%.WikiCulture. Experience shows that unrestricted write access works very well because:
	* There is enough peer pressure to post only appropriate content.
	* Content does not get lost because topics are under revision control.
	* A topic revision can be undone by a member of the %MAINWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup in case needed.
