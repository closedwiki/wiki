List of TWiki users. Please take the time to add yourself to the list in alphabetical order. Make sure to use the correct WikiNotation for your name. Add also your Intranet login name and date. 

*Note:* TWiki uses this topic to translate the Intranet login name (e.g. bclinton) to the TWiki user name (e.g. BillClinton). TWiki depends on this, for example to automatically add the signature to a new topic. Please make sure to use this format: <br> 3 spaces * Main.yourWikiName - yourIntranetLoginName - today's date in ISO format

*Note:* Above note only applies to a TWiki installed on an Intranet with a user logon. If you install TWiki on a server without authentication, all users are automatically assigned as _TWikiGuest - gu<nop>est_ . In this case TWiki does not distinguish between users.
