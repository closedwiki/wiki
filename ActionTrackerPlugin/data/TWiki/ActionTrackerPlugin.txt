---++!! Action Tracker Plugin

This plugin provides support for action tracking and notification in meeting minutes. It can also be used for private reminders, for example TODO lists and diary entries. _( Discussion in TWiki:Plugins/ActionTrackerPluginDev )_

%TOC%

---++ Features

	* Action tags may be added to TWiki topics that will be displayed formatted in-line.
	* Actions in a web can also be listed using searches.
	* A script is provided for automatic action notification.
	* Actions can be assigned to individuals, or to predefined groups of individuals.
	* Fully configurable.

---++ Syntax Rules

---+++ Actions

Write the command =%<nop>ACTION{ attributes }%= anywhere in a TWiki topic. All the text following the final % up to the next end-of-line is taken as the action description. Standard attributes are
	| *Name* | *Value* | *Description* |
	| =who= | See [[#PeopleAnchor][People]] | The person or team responsible for completing the action. %GREEN% Auto-completed %ENDCOLOR%. |
	| =due= | See [[#DateFormats][Date Formats]] | The due date |
	| =state= | =open= or =closed= | Set to "open" if the action is still open; Set to "closed" if the action is closed. To extend the state set, see [[#SettingsStateSet][Settings]], below. |
	| =notify= | See [[#PeopleAnchor][People]] | wiki names, or e-mail addresses, of people to notify when the action changes. |
	| =creator= | See [[#PeopleAnchor][People]] | Who created the action. %GREEN% Auto-completed %ENDCOLOR%. |
	| =created= | See [[#DateFormats][Date Formats]] | Date the action was created. %GREEN% Auto-completed %ENDCOLOR%. |
	| =closer= | See [[#PeopleAnchor][People]] | Who closed the action. %GREEN% Auto-completed %ENDCOLOR%. |
	| =closed= | See [[#DateFormats][Date Formats]] | Date the action was closed, if ever. %GREEN% Auto-completed %ENDCOLOR%. |
	| =uid= | UID string | Unique ID of the action. %GREEN% Auto-completed %ENDCOLOR%. |

For example,
<pre>
%<nop>ACTION{ who="TWikiGuest" due="2 Jan 2004" state="open" notify="AttillaTheHun" }% An action for TWikiGuest
</pre>
The fields marked %GREEN% Auto-completed %ENDCOLOR% are automatically filled in when you save the topic containing the action if you don't supply a value. =who=, =creator= and =closer= default to the name of the person doing the saving, and =created= and =closed= default to todays date (=closed= and =closer= are only filled in if the state is set to =closed=). You can override this behaviour by providing values for any of these attributes when you type the action. Note: you are __not__ recommended to provide a value for the =uid= field!

#DateFormats
---++++ Date formats
Date formats must be as recognised by =Time::Parse<nop>Date=.
The following absolute date formats are recognised. Dates containing spaces must be enclosed in double-quotes.
	* Dow, dd Month yy
	* Dow, dd Month yyyy
	* Dow, dd Month
	* dd Month yy
	* dd Month yyyy
	* Month day{st,nd,rd,th}, year
	* Month dd yyyy
	* yyyy/mm/dd
	* yyyy/mm
	* mm/dd/yy
	* mm/dd/yyyy
	* mm/yy
	* yy/mm		(only if year > 12)
	* yy/mm/dd	(only if year > 12 and day < 32)

You are *strongly* recommended never to use the 'mm/dd/yyyy or mm/dd/yyyy' formats, to avoid confusing users in Europe (like me).

#PeopleAnchor
---++++ People
People are identified to the action tracker using a wiki name or an e-mail address. The e-mail address is useful if you want to notify people who aren't registered, but bear in mind that if they are outside your firewall, the chances are they won't be able to edit pages and close actions.

E-mail addresses of people are found by the process [[#TranslatingNamesToEMailAddresses][described below]].

You can also use the shortahnd =me= for the currently logged-in user (this is 'TWikiGuest' unless you have been prompted for a username and password). In actions this will automatically be expanded when the topic is saved, and in searches it will match the currently logged in user. 

---+++++ Assigning actions or notifies to groups

You can assign an action to a group defined using a TWiki group topic (see %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiDocumentation). Alternatively you can give a list of people as the value of the attribute. For example,
<pre>
%ACTION<nop>{who=TWikiAdminGroup ...}%
%ACTION<nop>{who="KnutHaraldsen,MagnusMagnusson" ...}%
</pre>
__Note__ in general you should not use these mechanisms for assigning actions using =who=, because the actions so created are not specific. Actions should be assigned to one person only.

---+++ Action searches

Write the command =%<nop>ACTIONSEARCH{ attributes }%= anywhere in a TWiki topic. Standard attributes are
	| *Name* | *Value* | *Description* |
	| =who= | See [[#PeopleAnchor][People]] | Person responsible for closing the action. |
	| =notify= | See [[#PeopleAnchor][People]] | Persons who want to be notified of a change |
	| =state= | =late=, =open= or =closed= | Set to =late= to search for late actions; Set to "open" to search for open actions;<br /> Set to "closed" to search for closed actions. See [[#Settings][Settings]] for details on how to extend the state set. |
	| =within= | a number of days | Search for actions that are within a number of days of their due date |
	| =web= | Perl regular expression | A regular expression that matches the names of all the webs to search. If this attribute is omitted, the default is to search only the current web. Searching many webs is much slower, especially in a large installation. Webs marked NOSEARCHALL will not be searched. | 
	| =topic= | Perl regular expression | A regular expression that matches the names of all the topics to search. If this attribute is omitted, the default is to search all the topics in the selected webs. | 
	| =due= | See [[#DateFormats][Date Formats]] | Due date for the action. |
	| =creator= | See [[#PeopleAnchor][People]] | Who created the action. |
	| =created= | See [[#DateFormats][Date Formats]] | Date the action was created. |
	| =closed= | See [[#DateFormats][Date Formats]] | Date the action was closed, if ever. |
	| =closer= | See [[#PeopleAnchor][People]] | Who closed the action. |
	| =uid= | UID string | Unique ID of the action. |
	| format | Presentation format | See [[#FormattingTables][Formatting tables]] |
	| header | Presentation format | See [[#FormattingTables][Formatting tables]] |
	| orient | Presentation format | See [[#FormattingTables][Formatting tables]] |
	| sort | Comma-separated list of field names | Fields to sort the matched actions by. For example, <code>sort="$who,$due"</code> will sort by who first and then due. This field is optional; by default the table will be sorted by due date. |
For example,
<pre>
%<nop>ACTIONSEARCH{ who="me" state="late" }%
%<nop>ACTIONSEARCH{ who="TWikiGuest" state="open" within="7" }%
%<nop>ACTIONSEARCH{ web=".*" who="Genghis.Khan@mongol.empire.org" state="open" within="7" }%
</pre>

#QueryByExample
---++++ Query-by-example action search

<form name="searchaction" action="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%#QueryByExample">
|  Who: | <input type="text" name="qwho" value="%URLPARAM{"qwho"}%" size="20" /> |
|  Notify: | <input type="text" name="qnotify" value="%URLPARAM{"qnotify"}%" size="20" /> |
|  State: | <select name="qstate"> <option>%URLPARAM{"qstate"}%</option> <option>open</option> <option>late</option> <option>closed</option> <option></option> </select> |
|  Within: | <input type="text" name="qwithin" value="%URLPARAM{"qwithin"}%" size="3" /> days |
|  Web: | <input type="text" name="qweb" value="%URLPARAM{"qweb"}%" size="20" /> |
|  Topic: | <input type="text" name="qtopic" value="%URLPARAM{"qtopic"}%" size="20" /> |
| | <input type="submit" value="Go" /> |
</form>
Result:
%ACTIONSEARCH{ who="%URLPARAM{"qwho"}%" notify="%URLPARAM{"qnotify"}%" state="%URLPARAM{"qstate"}%" within="%URLPARAM{"qwithin"}%" web="%URLPARAM{"qweb"}%" topic="%URLPARAM{"qtopic"}%" }%

#FormattingTables
---+++ Formatting tables
The =header=, =format= and =orient= parameters support formatting of the action table using a similar syntax to that described in %TWIKIWEB%.FormattedSearch. For example:
<pre>
%<nop>ACTIONSEARCH{ who="WinstonChurchill" format="|$text|$edit|" header="|Policies||"}%
</pre>

| *Name:* | *Expands To:* |
| =$who= | Who is responsible for the action |
| =$due= | When the action is due |
| =$state= | Current state of the action (see also note below) |
| =$notify= | Who to notify when the action state changes |
| =$closed= | When the action was closed, and who closed it |
| =$creator= | Who created the action |
| =$created= | When the action was created |
| =$edit= | A link to the action editor for this action |
| =$uid= | Unique identifier for the action |
| =$web= | Name of the web containing the action |
| =$topic= | Topic name containing the action |
| =$text= | Formatted action text |
| =$n= or =$n()= | New line |
| =$nop= or =$nop()= | Is a "no operation". This variable gets removed. |
| =$quot= | Double quote (="=). |
| =$percnt= | Percent sign (=%=) |
| =$dollar= | Dollar sign (=$=) |

A default format for actions and action search results can be defined in this topic or the Web<nop>Preferences topic of the current web. See [[#SettingsAnchor][Settings]] for more details.

---+++ Notification

%TOPIC% comes with a notifier script, like the =mailnotify= script used for WebNotify (see TWiki.MonitoringSiteActivity for more information on setting up mailnotify). This script allows you to
	* examine all the actions in all webs (except those specified NOSEARCHALL) and notify owners of the state of actions,
	* find actions that have changed state and notify people who have registered an interest in that action.

The frequency with which actions are notified depends on how you set up your cron (or equivalent) jobs on the server.

The =actionnotify= script interprets its parameters as a search expression of the same type as that used in %<nop>ACTIONSEARCH%. All actions which match that expression will be notified to their owners. For example, you could set up the cron jobs as follows:
<pre>
0 * * * * /home/twiki/bin/actionnotify "state=\"late\""
0 8,16 * * * /home/twiki/bin/actionnotify "state=\"open\" within=\"3\""
0 0 * * * /home/twiki/bin/actionnotify "state=\"open\" within=\"7\"
0 0 * * 1 /home/twiki/bin/actionnotify "state=\"open\" within=\"30\"
</pre>
(If you don't know cron, the first 5 fields are minute, hour, day of month, month and day of week. * means 'every'). This crontab will notify actions according to the schedule:
	1 Actions that are late will be notified every hour, on the hour
	2 Actions that are still open within three days of their due date will be notified twice a day, at 8am and 4pm
	3 Actions that are still open within seven days of their due date will be notified once a day, at midnight.
	4 Actions that are still open within thirty days of their due date will be notified once a week, at midnight on monday.
A rather aggressive schedule!

__Note:__ At Wind River they notify folks three times a week on Mon, Wed and Fri for open action items due within 8 days. <br /><font size="-2">Crontab entry for geeks: =0 0 * * 1,3,5 (cd /twiki1/httpd/twiki-bin; ./actionnotify state=open within=8 'web=<nop>[CEIMPSW].*' &gt; /twiki1/httpd/htdocs/pub/actionnotify.txt 2&gt;&amp;1)= </font>

You can configure the fields which are scanned to detect state changes; see [[#SettingsNotify][Settings]].

#TranslatingNamesToEMailAddresses
The wiki name of the user to be notified is translated to a mail address according to the following rules:
	* If the user has a personal page, and that personal page contains a line or lines matching<br />
	_spaces_ * Email: _email address_ <br />
	or<br />
	_three spaces_ * E-mail: _email address_ <br />
	Alternatively if the topic is a group definition (the name ends in 'Group') then the line<br /> _spaces_ * Set GROUP =<br /> is used to determine the wikinames of the people in the group. These are resolved to email addresses recursively.
	then the notification is sent to that address. If that fails, 
	* If they appear in *any* WebNotify in *any* web, in the form of a line that gives an email address, then that address is used.
	* If they are listed in WebNotify *in any web*, the mail address given there is used.
*all* those e-mail addresses. This is how you assign actions to groups.
	* If this fails and the 'who' name is a valid e-mail address, for example person@domain.co.uk, then that name is used.

The =actionnotify= script is also used to notify users who have registered an interest in being notified when an action changes. This function of the script is activated when you use the special =changedsince= parameter.

__Note:__ When =changedsince= is active the other functions of the script, as described above, are disabled.

=changedsince= is used to specify the time period within which changed actions are interesting. Any action which has changed in the given period will be notified to all users who have registered an interest using =notify=. The =changedsince= value is a relative date string, which uses the following formats 
	* yesterday
	* last _dow_ (e.g. "last monday")
	* last week
	* now - _count_ _units_ (e.g. "now - 3 days")
	* - _count_ _units_
	* _count_ _units_ ago
where _units_ may be minutes, days, hours, weeks, months or even years. _count_ is just an integer. _dow_ is the name of a day of the week.

Obviously you have to be careful to synchronise your =changedsince= expression with the activation of your cron job. The ideal is to specify the same delta as the gap between cron activations. For example,
<pre>
0 0 * * * /home/twiki/bin/actionnotify "web=\"News\" changedsince=\"yesterday\""
</pre>
will notify registered users of action changes that occurred in the last 24 hours.

Not all action changes get notified; only changes to the action state, or changes to the text of the action (usually additions) get notified. For example, if the person responsible for the action is changed, or its due date, then no notification is generated.

#NonStandardAttributes
---++ Non-standard Attributes
As well as the standard attributes you can add non-standard attributes to actions, and use them in searches. For example:
<pre>
%<nop>ACTION{ who="EmperorHadrian" due="1 Jan 0053" state="closed" legion="7th" cohort="6th" maniple="3rd" }% Build a wall to keep the Scots out of England
</pre>

#SettingsStateSet
---+++ Defining non-standard attributes
Non-standard attributes must be lower-case words. The following names may not be used for non-standard attributes:
=closed=, =closer=, =created=, =creator=, =dollar=, =due=, =edit=, =format=, =header=, =late=, =n=, =nop=, =notify=, =percnt=, =quot=, =sort=, =state=, =text=, =topic=, =uid=, =web=, =who=, =within=.

To define non-standard attributes you need to set the value of EXTRAS in this topic (or to the Web<nop>Preferences topic of each web) - see [[#SettingsAnchor][Settings]] below. All attributes must be given a type, which is used by the formatter, the search engine and the action editor. For example,
<pre>
	* <nop>Set EXTRAS = |plaintiffs,names,16|decision,text,16|sentencing,date|sentence,select,"life","5 years","community service"|
</pre>
The following types are supported:
| *Type* | *Format* | *Description* |
| =select= | select, <i>size</i>, "option 1", "option 2", ... | Can take one of the string values option1, option2,.... etc. |
| =names= | names, <i>size</i> | One or more wiki names or e-mail addresses. |
| =text= | text, <i>size</i> | An arbitrary text field |
| =date= | date, <i>size</i> | A date in one of the formats described above. See [[#DateFormats][Date Formats]] |
In the above, <i>size</i> is a single number, which is the width (in characters) of the display box in the action editor.

__Note__ that there is one exception to the "no redefinition" rule above; the =state= attribute can be extended to take extra states. However the =closed= state must be retained, and must be the last state. To extend the set of states, simply include a definition of =state= in the EXTRAS definition:
<pre>
	* <nop>Set EXTRAS = |state,select,5,"open","fried","boiled","poached","closed"|
</pre>

---+++ Searching for non-standard attributes
You can of course search for values of non-standard attributes. For example:
<pre>
%<nop>ACTIONSEARCH{ sentence="life" }%
</pre>
If a non-standard attribute is declared as type =text= you can use perl regular expressions in the search.

#SettingsAnchor
---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Settings
These settings can be overridden in the Web<nop>Preferences topic of the current web (by defining ACTIONTRACKERPLUGIN_TABLEHEADER or ACTIONTRACKERPLUGIN_TABLEFORMAT etc).
	* One line description, shown in the TextFormattingRules topic
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Adds support for action tags in topics, and automatic notification of action statii
	* The format of an action output. The following fields can be output: web, topic, text, who, due, notify, uid, creator, state, edit. TABLEFORMAT defines the contents of the columns, TABLEHEADER defines the column headings. These settings can be overridden in an ACTIONSEARCH command using the =format= and =header= attributes. If TABLEORIENT is set to "rows", action tables will be aligned as rows of values instead of the default columns of values.
		* Set TABLEHEADER = | Assigned to | Due date | Description | State ||
		* Set TABLEFORMAT = | $who | $due | $text | $state | $edit |
		* Set TABLEORIENT = cols
	* The alternative text format of an action, used when mailing action or change notifications.
		* Set TEXTFORMAT = Action for $who, due $due, $state$n$text
	* The format of the action editor.
		* Set EDITHEADER = | Assigned to | Due date | State |
		* Set EDITFORMAT = | $who | $due | $state |
		* Set EDITORIENT = cols
	* If set to 1 will edit an action in a separate browser window (requires <nop>JavaScript)
		* Set USENEWWINDOW = 1
	* If set to 1, action edits will offer a 'Save Changes' instead of the usual 'Preview Changes' button. If this is set along with the USENEWWINDOW parameter, the subwindow _should_ close on save, but it won't because I haven't worked out how to do this safely.
		* Set NOPREVIEW = 1
	* Set the colours for late actions, errors and the table headers. Accepts standard HTML colours.
		* Set LATECOL = yellow
		* Set BADDATECOL = red
		* Set HEADERCOL = orange
#SettingsNotify
	* The fields to scan to detect changes for actionnotify. Changes in other fields are ignored.
		* Set NOTIFYCHANGES = $due,$state,$text
	* Non-standard attributes - see [[#SettingsStateSet][Defining non-standard attributes]] above.
		* Set EXTRAS = 

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions

__Note:__ These instructions are for the TWiki maintainer. No changes to your browser are required. *This plugin makes extensive use of new features added to TWiki in the 1 Feb 2003 release*. Earlier versions lack all the features described here. Make sure you install using the zip appropriate to your installation. If you install an earlier version of the plugin with the 1 Feb 2003 release, note that change notification will not function correctly.

	* Make sure you have Time::ParseDate installed in your perl installation (available from www.cpan.org)
	* Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below). Contents:
	| *File:* | *Description:* |
	| ==%TOPIC%.xml== | Ant build file |
	| ==data/TWiki/%TOPIC%.txt== | Plugin topic |
	| ==bin/actionnotify== | Mailer script |
	| ==templates/actionnotify.tmpl== | Page template for notify message |

	* Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory.
	* Add ==Plugins.%TOPIC%== to the ==INSTALLEDPLUGINS== variable in %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPreferences (or any WebPreferences topic).
	* Configure lib/TWiki/Plugins/ActionTrackerPlugin/Config.pm appropriately for your installation. Several of the configuration items are the same as in lib/TWiki.cfg - you can copy your local values from there if you're not sure what you're doing.
	* If the plugin is installed and enabled correctly you should see a formatted action below: %ACTION{who=TWikiGuest,due="1 Jan 2003",open}% Example action

---+++ Upgrade notes
Earlier versions of this plugin installed a number of files that are no longer required. Relative to the root of the TWiki installaion these are:
| *File* | *What's happened* |
| data/Plugins/ActionTrackerPlugin.txt | Moved to data/TWiki |
| templates/actionchangenotify.tmpl | Merged with actionnotify.tmpl |
| bin/editaction | Merged into plugin code, using hooks added in 1 Feb 2003 TWiki release |
| bin/previewaction | Merged into plugin code, using hooks added in 1 Feb 2003 TWiki release |

The mechanism for defining notification groups as lists of "EMail" lines in a topic in Main is no longer supported. Please upgrade to the mechanism described herein.

---++ %RED%Known Issues%ENDCOLOR%

---+++ Use of unpublished functions
The following unpublished TWiki core functions are used:
<pre>
TWiki::initialize()
TWiki::getGmDate()
TWiki::getTWikiLibDir()
TWiki::Net::sendEmail()
</pre>

---+++ Corruption of action items with Mozilla browser
Action lines are joined together if edited by a Mozilla browser, resulting in an odd display.
	* Work-around: Edit the topic ("Edit" at the bottom of the page, not the "edit" of the ActionTrackerPlugin) and add a new line to the =%<nop>ACTION{...}%=. Basically, each =%<nop>ACTION{...}%= needs to be on its own line. 

---+++ Behaviour of egrep

The output of the =$egrepCmd= in TWiki.cfg (with no switches) must be of the form:
	<pre>
	filename.txt: ...matched text...
	</pre>
	While this is true for all UNIX grep implementations, it may be a potential issue for other operating systems.

---+++ Further development

Further development of this code is welcomed. It is recommended that you unpack the distribution into a development directory and use the supplied Ant (http://jakarta.apache.org) build file which provides targets to run the test suite, and install and uninstall your development code into a test installation. Please, please, please run and extend the test set!

Some ideas:
   * Fix the "close subwindow on save" functionality. See ActionTrackerPlugin.pm, search for $submitScript.
   * It would be nice to generalise the search to support =within= and =late= style searches on all date fields, including non-standard ones.
   * A really brave soul might consider moving action change notification to where it belongs; in the beforeSaveHandler.
   * You could turn this into a full-blooded issue tracker by constraining state transitions.
