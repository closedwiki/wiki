%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

---++ Overview

Public TWiki sites are frequently visited by search engine spiders and non-autheticated users. The actual traffic by authenticated users who browse and change content is typically less than 5% of all traffic. This add-on is designed to cache topics for non-autheticated users. Content is not cached for authenticated users - this ensures that personalized content remains personalized.

A typical TWiki page may load in about 1 second. A cached topic loads about 10 times faster.

Deploying this add-on on a public TWiki site tends to speed up the site for all users. It also reduces the CPU load considerably on a high traffic site. On TWiki.org the average CPU load dropped from 2-3 down to 0.2-0.5 after deploying this add-on.

---++ Cache Algorithm

Once the add-on is installed and configured it can be forgotten, the caching and cache update is done automatically.

A topic is only cached if:

   * the user is _not_ authenticated,
   * the requested URL has no parameters,
   * the requested topic exists.

The cached content is returned if all conditions are met and if the cache exists. If needed, a topic is cached or re-cached first.

A configurable cache invalidation determines when a topic is re-cached. There are three tiers:

   * Tier 1 topics, such as =WebChanges, !WebRss=: Cache invalidation is 1 hour by default.
   * Tier 2 topics, such as =WebHome, !WebTopicList=: Cache invalidation is 6 hours by default.
   * Other topics: Cache invalidation is 48 hours by default.

---++ Installation Instructions

__Note:__ You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this add-on. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the add-on on the TWiki server.

   * For an __automated installation__, run the [[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%][configure]] script and follow "Find More Extensions" in the in the __Extensions__ section. 
      * See the [[http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/BuildContribInstallationSupplement][installation supplement]] on TWiki.org for more information.

   * Or, follow these __manual installation__ steps: 
      * Download the ZIP file from the Plugins home (see below).
      * Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:
        | *File:* | *Description:* |
        | ==data/TWiki/%TOPIC%.txt== | Add-on topic |
        | ==bin/viewcache== | View script with cache logic |
        | ==lib/TWiki/Contrib/%TOPIC%.pm== | Add-on Perl module |
        | ==lib/TWiki/Contrib/%TOPIC%/Config.spec== | Spec file for configure |
      * Set the ownership of the extracted directories and files to the webserver user.
      * Make sure the =wget= command is installed.
   * Add-on __configuration and testing__:
      * Configure the <nop>%TOPIC% settings in the __Extensions__ section.
         * Settings:
           %BR% =# Comma-space delimited list of tier 1 topic names:=
           %BR% =$TWiki::cfg{TWikiGuestCacheAddOn}{Tier1Topics} = 'WebAtom, !WebChanges, !WebRss';=
           %BR% =# Maximum cache age for tier 1 pages, in hours:=
           %BR% =$TWiki::cfg{TWikiGuestCacheAddOn}{Tier1CacheAge} = '1';=
           %BR% =# Comma-space delimited list of tier 2 topic names:=
           %BR% =$TWiki::cfg{TWikiGuestCacheAddOn}{Tier2Topics} = 'WebHome, !WebTopicList';=
           %BR% =# Maximum cache age for tier 2 pages, in hours:=
           %BR% =$TWiki::cfg{TWikiGuestCacheAddOn}{Tier2CacheAge} = '6';=
           %BR% =# Maximum cache age for default pages, in hours:=
           %BR% =$TWiki::cfg{TWikiGuestCacheAddOn}{CacheAge} = '48';=
           %BR% =# wget command:=
           %BR% =$TWiki::cfg{TWikiGuestCacheAddOn}{WgetCmd} = '/usr/bin/wget --user-agent=TWikiGuestCacheAddOn -O';=
           %BR% =# Debug flag:=
           %BR% =$TWiki::cfg{TWikiGuestCacheAddOn}{Debug} = 0;=
      * Copy the =twiki/bin/viewcache= script to =twiki/bin/view= (overwrite the latter).
      * Test if the installation was successful:
         * Logout and view a topic as a not authenticated user.
         * On the shell, check if the cache file =twiki/pub/.cache/&lt;web&gt;/&lt;topic&gt;.html= has been created.
         * The second time you view a topic, it should load much faster.
         * Look at the tail of the TWiki log file =twiki/data/log%SERVERTIME{$year$mo}%.txt= to verify that cached content is returned you should see ="from cache"= entries. Example:%BR% =| %SERVERTIME{$year-$mo-$day - $hour:$min}% | guest | view | !Support.SupportForum | Mozilla - from cache | 1.2.3.4 |=
