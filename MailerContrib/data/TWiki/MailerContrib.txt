%TOC%

---++ Summary of Contents
---+++ <code>tools/mailnotify</code>
The main part of the mailer module is a script, =tools/mailnotify=. This script is designed to be run from 'cron' (or an equivalent offline job scheduler), and processes the contents of the standard <nop>%NOTIFYTOPIC% topic. As well as providing the usual notification service, it also provides per-topic notification services. The script may be run from the command line or a cron job.

<!-- Included by %TWIKIWEB%.WebChangesAlert -->
%STARTINCLUDE%
Subscribers are listed in <nop>%NOTIFYTOPIC% following one of these bullet list formats:

_three spaces_ * [ _webname_ . ] _wikiName_ - _SMTP mail address_ <br />
_three spaces_ * [ _webName_ . ] _wikiName_ <br />
_three spaces_ * _SMTP mail address_ <br />
_three spaces_ * _SMTP mail address_ : _topics_ <br />
_three spaces_ * [ _webname_ . ] _wikiName_ : _topics_

where _topics_ is a space-separated list of topic names.
   * Specify topics without a _Web._ prefix
   * Topics must exist in this web.
   * Topics may be specified using * wildcards
   * Each topic may optionally be followed by an integer in parentheses, indicating the depth of the tree of children below that topic. Changes in all these children will be detected and reported along with changes to the topic itself. _Note_ This uses the TWiki "Topic parent" feature.
   * Each topic may optionally be preceded by a '+' or '-' sign. The '+' sign means "subscribe to this topic" (the same as not putting anything). The '-' sign means "don't send notifications regarding this topic". This allows users to elect to filter out changes to certain topics (and their children, to an arbitrary depth). Topic filters ('-') take precedence over topic includes ('+').

For example:
<verbatim>
   * daisy@flowers.com
   * daisy@flowers.com: Web*
   * DaisyCutter: Petal* (1) WeedKillers (3) Red*Phlox
   * StarTrekFan: * - *Wars - *sInTheirEyes - *shipTroopers
</verbatim>
A user may be listed many times in the <nop>%NOTIFYTOPIC% topic. Where a user has several lines in <nop>%NOTIFYTOPIC% that all match the same topic, they will only be notified of changes to that topic _once_.

If a _TWiki group_ is listed for notification, the group will be recursively expanded to the e-mail addresses of all members.

__%T% Tip:__ List names in alphabetical order to make it easier to find the names.
%STOPINCLUDE%

In the future it is intended that individual users will be able to control the frequency with which they are notified of topic changes, by changing a schedule specification in their home topic. However at present, the notification schedule is controlled by the frequency of activation of the =cron= job that runs the =mailnotify= script.

%RED% __Note__ =mailnotify= ignores permissions in webs. It is entirely possible for a user to get added to a <nop>%NOTIFYTOPIC% topic in a web, when they are not authorised to view the topics in that web. This could result in them having limited access to sensitive information (the topic summaries). %ENDCOLOR%

---+++ <code>TWiki/Contrib/MailerContrib</code> code library
The second part of the module is a code library that provides the services for other applications to modify <nop>%NOTIFYTOPIC% through a clean, well documented interface. This allows (for example) plugin developers to add a "Register me for notification" button to their pages. The main interface is the =Web<nop>Notify= package described below.

---++ Installation Instructions
This Contrib is pre-installed as part of the TWiki release package, and should only have to be re-installed if an upgrade is required.
   * Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below)
   * Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory.
   * Run the installer script =MailContrib_intaller.pl= or alternatively resolve all dependencies manually.
   * To make sure the installation was successful, run the =mailnotify= script from the command line, with no parameters. In this case it will print out what it would have done to STDOUT.

---++ Setting up your cron job
You need to set up a =cron= (or equivalent) job to run =tools/mailnotify=.

Usage: <code>perl -I &lt;bin&gt; mailnotify [-q] [ <i>web1 web2 ... webN</i> ]</code>
&lt;bin&gt; is the path to the TWiki bin directory, so that the script can find the rest of TWiki.
| =-q= | Don't print progress information |
| <code><i>web1 web2 ... webN</i></code> | List of webs to process, separated by spaces or commas. Default is to process all legal TWiki webs. Wildcards (*) are supported. |
For example, assuming TWiki was installed at =/usr/local/twiki=, this cron entry:
<verbatim>
0 0 * * * cd /usr/local/twiki && perl -I bin tools/mailnotify -q Public Private
</verbatim>
will generate notifications for the =Public= and =Private= webs every night at midnight.

---++ Settings
	* Set STUB = TWiki::Contrib::Mailer
	* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Supports e-mail notification of changes.
