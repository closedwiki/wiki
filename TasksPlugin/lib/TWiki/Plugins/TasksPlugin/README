Although distributed as a "plugin", the off-line task management framework is a complete operating environment for
off-line processing of TWiki tasks.

Beyond the standard installation, the following steps are required.

If you are running a TWiki release prior to V5.1.0, you need to apply the patch found at
 http://twiki.org/p/pub/Codev/ConfigureSupportForTaskFramework/tfwconfigure.patch

After un-taring the kit from the wiki root:

Run "tools/Tasks/Install.pl install" to setup permissions, links and system startup.

Install has lots of options, but the defaults should work for most standard installations.
There are options for various non-standard situations; see --help.

-v will list every action.
-n will prevent making any changes; use with -v if you want to see
   what will happen before commiting.

In configure, {AuthScripts} needs to include TaskDaemon.  This is an EXPERT setting
under Security Setup -> Authentication.

In httpd/conf.d/twiki.conf, add TaskDaemon to the FilesMatch requiring authentication:

<FilesMatch "(attach|edit|manage|rename|save|upload|mail|logon|rest|TaskDaemon|.*auth).*">
   require valid-user
</FilesMatch>

SeLinux - policy changes required - see tools/Tasks/localWiki.{te,if,fc}, plus:

semanage -i - <<EOF
boolean -1 httpd_can_network_connect
boolean -1 httpd_can_sendmail
boolean -1 httpd_enable_homedirs
boolean -1 httpd_read_user_content
boolean -1 httpd_unified
EOF

If your attempt to run from a svn repository or other home directory, many more
policy changes are required.  Contact the author for the latest information.

Also, if not running under fedora, create a mapfile for permissions (see Install --help).
Please submit your file so that it can be distributed in future releases.

Mapfile may also be helpful if you use permissions/file owners other than the default.

Review and adjust configure settings under Off-line Tasks, as well as enabling the TasksPlugin.

Versions of this software are maintained for both TWiki & Foswiki.  A developer's kit contains
some modules used only for manual testing that are omitted from the standard distribution and
file(s) used when building from a common platform repository.

This software is pure perl, although it relies on CPAN modules that aren't.  It was
developed on Linux (Fedora) and should be reasonably portable to other Unix environments.

There are some known issues with CPAN modules that may impact some users.  All have work-arounds/proposed patches in the bug trackers.  See:
 IPV6:
 o https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=79557

 Encrypted Private key files (use DES3 as a work-around)
 o https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=79927

The software has not been tested on Windows or VMS - there are probably some filename issues on the
latter.  Patches are welcome, but of course subject to review.

Feedback is welcome, as are contributions.  Please note that the plugin/driver APIs will
(hopefully) be used by many other developers.  Any changes require careful review for
compatibility and security.
