# Host-specific policy for wikiworld.

# fedora-specific mappings for selinux types, file permissions and file owners
#
# If you have a different host-specific policy, you can copy this file to
# lib/MANIFEST.map.<hostname>, where <hostname> is the name of the host as
# returned by perl -MSys::Hostname -e'print hostname'.  This file will
# completely override any other MANIFEST.map file in your environment.
#
# If you have a different site policy, you can copy this file to
# lib/MANIFEST.map.LocalSite and adjust as desired.  lib/MANIFEST.map.LocalSite
# will override any other MANIFEST.map file in your environment, except a
# lib/MANIFEST.map.<hostname>.

# These hashes define the mapping from the octal permissions in the MANIFEST to the installed permissions.
# You can also override the permissions for a specific file or directory by entering its
# name (root-relative, as in MANIFEST) in the map.  No umask is applied in this case.
#
# Note that this mapping is applied BEFORE any file or directory umask.  
# Defaults to the identity mapping if no entry in hash.
#
# This would normally be a site policy rather than distribution-specific.
# For example, a site that accesses files by group rather than owner might swap the user and group digits.  
# Or a site might want to add the setgid bit to directory permissions
#
# A site can also specify default file and directory umasks here to avoid having to specify them on the command line.
