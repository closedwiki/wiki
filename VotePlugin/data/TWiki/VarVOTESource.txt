   * The following standard attributes are recognized
   | *Name* | *Description* | *Example* |
   | =id= | \
The identifier of the poll. \
You can have multiple independent votes in the same \
topic. | =id="Dining"= |
   | =select<i>N</i>= | \
Defines the name of a *select* vote, where you select one from a ranges of \
options. \
=N= is a number that identifies this item within the poll e.g. =select1=, =select2= etc. You must number all =select= and =stars= parameters uniquely and sequentially (e.g. =select1 stars2 select3= | =select1="Drink"= |
   | =options<i>N</i>= | \
Each =select<i>N</i>= must have a corresponding =options<i>N</i>= that \
defines a comma-separated list of the options that can be selected between. | =options1="Beer,Wine,Milk"= |
   | =stars<i>N</i>= | \
Defines the name of a *rate* vote, where you rate something by giving it \
a number of stars. \
=N= is a number that identifies this item within the poll e.g. =select1=, =stars2= etc. You must number all =select= and =stars= parameters uniquely and sequentially (e.g. =select1 stars2 select3= | =stars2="Usability"= |
   | =width<i>N</i>= | \
Each =stars<i>N</i>= must have a corresponding =width<i>N</i>=. This gives the number of \
stars to show e.g. =width1="5"= will show 5 stars. | =width2="10"= |
   | =format<i>N</i>= | \
Defines the format of the results display. See [[VotePlugin#FormattingResults][formatting results]], below. | =format="$large"= |
   | =chart<i>N</i>= | \
Defines the format of a single bar in the results bar chart generated for the corresponding  =select= (for =select= type only). See [[VotePlugin#FormattingResults][formatting results]], below. | =chart="&lt;p>$option $score&lt;/p>"= |
   | =separator= | Defines the string to be used to separate each row in the result. | =separator="&lt;br/>"= |
   | =global= | If set to ="off"=, this makes the =id= local to this topic (the default). If set to ="on"= it will be a global poll that can be accessed from many topics. | =global="on"= |
   | =open= | If set to ="off"= this is a closed vote. If set to ="on"= it is open (the default) | =open="on"= |
   | =secret= | If set to ="off"=, then the database will record who voted. If set to ="on"=, votes are secret (the default) | =secret="on"= |
   | =saveto= | If set to the name of a topic, the poll results will be appended to the end of that topic. The results are formatted as a TWiki table for easy post-processing. | =saveto="Main.<nop>VoteResults"= |
   | =bayesian= | If set to ="on"=, rating averages will be computed using the Bayesian average of this item against all the other items _that have the same item in their =stars= field_. This requires all the participating %VOTEs to be =global=, or to save their results to the same place using =saveto=. See http://www.thebroth.com/blog/118/bayesian-rating for more information about Bayesian rating. | =bayesian="off"= |
   | =submit= | If set to ="off"=, this makes the %VOTE display the results of the vote without prompting for any input. This is useful when - for example - you want to show the results of a global vote, without permitting more voting. |
