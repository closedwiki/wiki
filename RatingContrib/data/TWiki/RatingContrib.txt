---++ Usage

---+++ In TWiki < 4.2

The rating widget can be used with the TWiki:Plugins.VotePlugin. The widget is like the TWiki:Plugins.JSCalendarContrib in that once it is installed, it can be used with any plugin that requires a line - of - stars rating bar. 

---+++ In TWiki 4.2 and later

You can use the new =rating= type in form fields. The result of the rating is captured as an integer, and displayed as a line of stars. For example,

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/example_stars.gif" />

Install the contrib into your TWiki. You can immediately use the =rating= type in your forms. Rating values are stored as integers.

To use it in a TWiki form, use the type =rating=, with the optional modified =+small= for small stars. The size field dictates how wide the rating is e.g. 5 means a 5 star range. The value field specifies the initial value. For example, the form definition:

<verbatim>
| *Name*     | *Type*       | *Size* | *Values* |
| Supplier   | text         | 40     |          |
| Quality    | rating+small | 10     | 5        |
| Order Date | date         |        |          |
</verbatim>
looks like this when it is edited:

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/edit_example.gif" />

---++ Using the Contrib in a Plugin

A typical application of this widget is its use to capture a rating under the control of a plugin. It is straightforward to use in this role. The API to the contrib is:

=TWiki::Contrib::RatingContrib::renderRating($name, $size, $small, $value, $input_attrs) -> $html=

where
   * =$name= is the name you want to give to the =input= element that will get the rating value
   * =$size= is the total width of the rating bar, typically 5 or 10
   * =$small= is a boolean; if true, use small (10px) stars in place of the default (25px) stars
   * =$value= is the current value of the rating. This may be a floating-point value, but should be in the range =0..$size=
   * =$input_attrs= is a hash that contains additional attributes to be assigned to the =input= element used to capture the rating value. Typically the only attribute callers will need to use is =onchange=, which should be set to a callback that will be invoked when the value in the =input= is changed. If you pass =undef= for this parameter, then the line of stars will be "read only".
The contrib will automatically look after the CSS and Javascript it needs to load to work.

For example, let's say we want to generate a conventional form that contains a line of stars prompt. We want the value of the rating bar to be submitted along with everything else in the form.
<verbatim>
my $html =
   CGI::form({action="some url", method=>"post"},
       TWiki::Contrib::RatingContrib::renderRating('rating', 5, 0, 0, {})
      .CGI::submit("OK"));
</verbatim>

Say instead that we want to generate an alert when a line of stars has its
value changed:
<verbatim>
$html = TWiki::Contrib::RatingContrib::renderRating('rating', 5, 0, 0,
        {onchange=>'javascript: alert("Rated")'})
</verbatim>
Of course, when you use the =onchange= event, you don't need a form. This model
is good if you want (for example) to update values using a REST handler.
