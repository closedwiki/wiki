---+ <nop>%TOPIC%

Use the ==#<nop>#.==, ==#<nop>#..== _etc._ notation (that is, hash-hash-dot-dot-dot...) to insert outline numbering sequences (1, 1.1, 2, 2.1) in topic's text. Multiple named sequences and sequence re-initialization is supported.

---++ Syntax Rules

	* The default outline numbering sequence uses the notation =#<nop>#...= (with 1-6 dots). The notation is replaced anywhere in the topic. The level number corresponding to the number of dots increases with each use. Each time a level is used, all higher levels are reset to 0.

	* Named numbering sequences can be used with the notation =#<nop>#name#...= for sequence =name=. Named sequences have independent numbering.

	* The numbering of a sequence can be initialized or re-initialized by adding a =0= into to notation: =#<nop>#name#0...= anywhere in the topic. All numbers are re-initialized. This is essential when using a sequence within headers that are also used in a *%<nop>TOC%*. In that case, start the first heading using something like =---+ Chapter #<nop>#0. Introduction=. You can then safely use the number notation in headings.

	* The rendering of the numbering sequence can be turned into an letter-labeled list by appending a lowercase letter to the notation: =#<nop>#...a=

	* The maximum number of levels is 6, and using levels higher than maximum implies the last level.

---++ Examples

If you have the plugin installed, the *Rendered* and *Expected* columns should be identical.
If you do not have the plugin installed, the *Rendered* column will be the same as the *Source* column.

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Global Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>EXPLICITNUMBERINGPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==

	* One line description, is shown in the %TWIKIWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Use the ==#<nop>#.==, ==#<nop>#..== _etc._ notation to insert outline numbering sequences (1, 1.1, 2, 2.1) in topic's text. Multiple named sequences and sequence re-initialization is supported.

	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0
