Notes:

	* this will only persist for your session and this will only work if the SessionPlugin in installed

	* this assumes that %<nop>SKINS% has a comma-separated list of available skins in it

	* this page will not work correctly if you came to it directly. Call it with CGI parameters ==fromweb== and ==fromtopic==. Clicking ==Go== above will then refresh to that web and that topic with your desired skin stuck to your session until you clear it with the ==default== skin.
		* see %TWIKIWEB%.SessionPlugin for an example of how to use this page

	* this page serves as an example of how one might use %<nop>SKINSELECT%
