---+ Kwiki to TWiki Text File Converter

This script is a mod of Main.PeterThoeny's DolphinToTWikiAddOn for people who want to import content from Main.BrianIngerson's Kwiki into a TWiki.

Converts pretty much everything, although there are idiosyncracies.

Metadata is not converted, however suitable default metadata is created.

(Seems like there were some changes to what is in TWiki.cfg, for instance $revCiDateCmd)

---++ Usage

I might as well copy liberally from Thoeny's documentation as well. ;-)

==example% kwiki2twiki.pl fromDir toDir==

| =fromDir:= | Directory containing Kwiki files |
| =toDir:= | Directory where converted .txt and .txt,v files are stored |

__Attention:__ =toDir= is assumed to be empty. Existing files will be overwritten!
