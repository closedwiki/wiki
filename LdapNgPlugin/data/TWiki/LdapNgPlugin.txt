%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

---++ Introduction

This plugin provides an interface to query an LDAP directory and display the results in a TWiki topic. It is a complete rewrite of the TWiki:Plugins.LdapPlugin by TWiki:Main.GerardHickey to provide greater flexibility and performance based on the TWiki:Plugins.LdapContrib package.

---++ Tags provided by the plug-in

[[VarLDAP][%<nop>LDAP{...}%]] and [[VarLDAPUSERS][%<nop>LDAPUSERS{...}%]] are provided by this plug-in
 
---++ Examples
<pre>
%<nop>LDAP{"(objectClass=posixAccount)" 
  base="(ou=people)"
  limit="10" 
  header="| *Nr* | *Name* | *Mail* | *Photo* |$n" 
  format="| $index | $cn | $mail | &lt;img src=\"$jpegPhoto\" alt=\"$cn\" title=\"$cn\" width=\"100px\"&gt; |" 
  footer="$n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='red'&gt;$count users&lt;/font&gt;" 
  sort="cn"
%IF{"{Plugins}{LdapNgPlugin}{AutoClear}" else="  clear=\"$mail,$jpegPhoto\"
"}%}%

%<nop>LDAP{"(objectClass=posixGroup)" 
  base="(ou=group)" 
  limit="10" 
  header="| *Nr* | *Group* | *Members* |$n" 
  format="| $index | $cn | $memberUid |" 
  sort="cn"
%IF{"{Plugins}{LdapNgPlugin}{AutoClear}" else="  clear=\"$mail,$jpegPhoto\"
"}%}%

%<nop>LDAPUSERS{limit="10"}%
</pre>

---++ Plugin Settings

<!-- provided for compatibility only
   * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Query and display data from an LDAP directory
-->
The %TOPIC% will use the default configuration of the LdapContrib in your =LocalSite.cfg= file, that is
   * =$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{Host}= (overridable per query)
   * =$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{Port}= (overridable per query)
   * =$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{Base}= (overridable per query)
   * =$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{Version}= (overridable per query)
   * =$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{SSL}= (overridable per query)
   * =$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{BindDN}=
   * =$TWiki::cfg{Ldap}{BindPasswd}=

In addition, the following configuration items are there. All are optional and have no problem not setting.
   * =$TWiki::cfg{Plugins}{LdapNgPlugin}{UseDefaultServer}= %BR%
     You may have only one LDAP server and there is no point in sepcifying a server in %<nop>LDAP{...}%. Besides, !LdapContrib might be used elsewhere. If both conditions are met, you should consider setting this preference true. If so, this plug-in always ignore =host=, =port=, =version=, =ssl= parameters and connects to the LDAP server specified by the !LdapContrib configuration. The goal is to share an LDAP connection with other TWiki features using it.
   Please be noted the LDAP connection shared with others is not automatically destroyed. You need to make sure it's destroyed when a TWiki session is destroyed. Otherwise, if this plug-in is used in Fasc CGI or mod_perl, LDAP connections may accumulate.
   * =$TWiki::cfg{Plugins}{LdapNgPlugin}{DisableLDAPUSERS}= %BR%
     If you have thousands of users and uses LDAP, you need to disable %<nop>LDAPUSER{...} because it would yield a large amount of data otherwise.
   * =$TWiki::cfg{Plugins}{LdapNgPlugin}{Helper}= %BR%
     The class of helper functions. Please see #Helper_Class.
   * =$TWiki::cfg{Plugins}{LdapNgPlugin}{CacheBlob}= %BR%
     If true, attributes whose name contain jpegPhoto are cached. This is introduced on 2012-10-15. Before that, jpegPhoto data was always cached. As such, to keep the old behavior, you need to set this true.
   * =$TWiki::cfg{Plugins}{LdapNgPlugin}{AutoClear}= %BR%
     In the =format=, =header=, and =footer= parameters, =$attribute= which is not defined in a record ends up being literal =$attribute= in output.
     You need to put it in the =clear= parameter (e.g. =clear="$telephonenumber,$mobile"=) to suppress literal =$attribute= from showing up. %BR%
     Setting ={Plugins}{LdapNgPlugin}{AutoClear}= true makes the =clear= parameter unnecessary.
     However, this causes slight incompatibility in some cases.
     You may put =%<nop>LDAP{...}%= inside a tag and put =$something= for the outer tag. if ={Plugins}{LdapNgPlugin}{AutoClear}= is true, you need to put it as =$dollarsomething=.

---++ Helper Class

%<nop>LDAP{...}% basically does a single LDAP query as specified.
For practical use, that may be insufficient in two aspects.
   * There might be a user who doesn't care enough and issues an inappropriate query posing too much load to the server.
   * Some typical operations such as getting the list of the members of a group may be too cumbersome. For that, you need to nest two %<nop>LDAP{...}%s - the outer one gets the list of members while the inner one retrieves each member's attributes. It would be user friendly to do it by e.g. %<nop>LDAP{"group=GROUP_NAME" ...}%.

To cope with these issues, you can have your !LdapNgPlugin helper class by having the following line on lib/LocalSite.cfg.
<verbatim>
$TWiki::cfg{Plugins}{LdapNgPlugin}{Helper} = 'TWiki::Contrib::MyLdapNgPluginHelper';
</verbatim>
A helper class would be defined as follows:
<verbatim>
package TWiki::Contrib::MyLdapNgPluginHelper;

sub lookupHelper {
    my ($class, $ldap, $filter, $params) = @_;
...
</verbatim>
Currently =lookupHelper= is the only function expected in a !LdapNgPlugin helper class.

---+++ Arguments of lookupHelper()

$class gets the name of the class - "TWiki::Contrib::MyLdapNgPluginHelper" in this example.

$filter gets the =filter= parameter of %<nop>LDAP{...}%.

$params is a hash reference having values of the following parameters of %<nop>LDAP{...}%.
| *Name* | *Type* | *Default* |
| =scope= | string | =sub= |
| =skip= | number | 0 |
| =limit= | number | 0 |
| =sort= | array reference | =[]= |
| =reverse= | boolean | false |

---+++ Return value of lookupHelper()

It's supposed to return a string or an array reference depending on situation.
   $ An error : When an error occurred (e.g. the filter is not appropriate), an error message starting with = is returned.
   $ A filter string : it may return $filter as is or after transforming it.
   $ Array reference : it may return a referenct to an array of an LDAP query result. The result of a group=xxx filter would be in this type.

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions

   * Run configure for automated install, or do a manual install:
   * Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below)
   * Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:
     | *File:* | *Description:* |
%$MANIFEST%
   * Optionally, run ==%TOPIC%_installer.pl== to automatically check and
     install other TWiki modules that this module depends on. You can also do
     this step manually.
   * Alternatively, manually make sure the dependencies listed in the table
     below are resolved.
   * Visit =configure= in your TWiki installation, and enable the plugin in the {Plugins} section.
