---+ LDAP Password Changer TWiki Plugin

This plugin asks for and changes your password at a pre-configured LDAP server.
The users willing to change his/her password *must* be authenticated already.
This plugin *makes no sense* for the [[%MAINWEB%.TWikiGuest][Guest]] user.

---++ Syntax Rules

There is only one command to apply, just use =%<nop>LDAPPASSWORDCHANGER%= and the Plugin will do the rest. 

---++ <nop>%TOPIC% Global Settings

	* One line description, shown in the %TWIKIWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = LDAP Server user password automated changer.
	* The LDAP Server you will contact:
		* Set LDAP_SERVER = ldaps://ldap.yourcompany.com
	* Bind DN to bind to LDAP Server (leave empty to enable anonymous binding):
		* Set LDAP_BIND_DN = uid=%USERNAME%,ou=users,dc=yourcompany,dc=com
	* Base DN from where searches will start at your server
		* Set LDAP_BASE_DN = dc=yourcompany,dc=com
	* Filter to select the *current* user.
		* Set LDAP_FILTER = (&(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=%USERNAME%))
	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set DEBUG = 0

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions

__Note:__ You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this plugin. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the plugin on the server where TWiki is running.

	* Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below)
	* Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:

	  | ==data/TWiki/%TOPIC%.txt,v== | Plugin topic repository |
	  | ==lib/TWiki/Plugins/%TOPIC%.pm== | Plugin Perl module |
	* (Dakar) Visit =configure= in your TWiki installation, and enable the plugin in the {Plugins} section.
	* Test if the plugin is correctly installed:
		* After adjusting the =LDAP_SERVER=, =LDAP_BIND_DN=, =LDAP_BASE_DN=, and =LDAP_FILTER= settings above, visit [[Sandbox.%TOPIC%]].  You will see a dialog box asking you your old and new passwords. If you're able to fill the fields and change your LDAP Server user password, everything is ok.
