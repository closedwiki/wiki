---++ Description
The <nop>NatEdit is an wiki editor that helps in learning the <nop>TWikiMarkup Language
by providing a GUI. By design, this is not a wysiwyg editor that tries to generate the
correct TML in the background. Instead, the user is still in charge of writing correct
wiki markup but with a bit more of assistance as a plain browser textarea. Therefor
this editor helps to lower the learning curve but will not get in your way once
you are aware of wiki markup. 

<nop>NatEdit heavily depends on javascript. Hence browsers without
javascript are not supported.

---++ Configuration
Add the identifier =natedit= to the =SKIN= variable in Main.TWikiPreferences or
in your WebPreferences to enable it.  So in case you are using <nop>PatternSkin
this is
<verbatim>
* Set SKIN = natedit,pattern
</verbatim>
In case you are using <nop>NatSkin you don't have to install the NatEditContrib
because it is already part of the <nop>NatSkin.

If you want to customize the help text in the bottom part of the editor then
set the variable =NATEDIT_HELPTEXT= to the name of a topic that contains
the help text. The default is
<verbatim>
* Set NATEDIT_HELPTEXT = %TWIKIWEB%.NatEditHelpText
</verbatim>

To customize the format of the signature 
pressing the sign button 
<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/button_signature.png" alt="signature button" />,
set the =NATEDIT_SIGNATURE= preference variable. The default is
<verbatim>
* Set NATEDIT_SIGNATURE = '=--= ','%<nop>WIKIUSERNAME%',' - %<nop>DATE%'
</verbatim>
The =NATEDIT_SIGNATURE= variable has the format 
<verbatim>'<open-tag>', '<sample-text>', '<close-tag>'</verbatim>
When the respective button is pressed, =<open-tag><sample-text><close-tag>= 
will be inserted. If there's a current selection, then it will be used instead of the
=<sample-text>=.
